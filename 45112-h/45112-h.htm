<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>Astronomy, it has been said, is the oldest and the
noblest of the sciences. Yet it is one of the few sciences
for which most present-day educators seem to find
little, if any, room in their curriculum of study for
the young, in spite of its high cultural value. It is,
we are told, too abstruse a subject for the youthful
student. This is doubtless true of theoretical or mathematical
astronomy and the practical astronomy of the
navigator, surveyor and engineer, but it is not true of
general, descriptive astronomy. There are many different
aspects of this many-sided science, and some of
the simplest and grandest truths of astronomy can be
grasped by the intelligent child of twelve or fourteen
years of age.</p>

<p>Merely as a branch of nature study the child should
have some knowledge of the sun, moon, stars and
planets, their motions and their physical features, for
they are as truly a part of nature as are the birds,
trees and flowers, and the man, woman or child who
goes forth beneath the star-lit heavens at night absolutely
blind to the wonders and beauties of the universe
of which he is a part, loses as much as the one
who walks through field or forest with no thought of
the beauties of nature that surround him.</p>

<p>The astronomer is the pioneer and explorer of today<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
in realms unknown just as the pioneers and explorers
of several centuries ago were to some extent
astronomers as they sailed unknown seas and traversed
unexplored regions. As the years pass by the astronomer
extends more and more his explorations of the
universe and brings back among the fruits of discovery
measures of giant suns and estimates of the
form and extent of the universe, views of whirling,
seething nebulæ, mysterious dark clouds drifting
through space, tremendous solar upheavals or glimpses
of strangely marked surfaces of nearby planets.</p>

<p>In the following pages the author has endeavored to
tell in words not beyond the comprehension of the
average fourteen-year-old child something of the nature
of the heavenly bodies. In Part I an effort is made to
make the child familiar with the stars by indicating when
and where they can be found in the early evening hours.
In addition to identifying the principal constellations and
their brightest stars by means of diagrams an attempt
has been made to acquaint the child with the most interesting
recent discoveries that have been made concerning
the principal stars or objects in each group as well as
with some of the stories and legends that have been associated
with these groups of stars for centuries, and
that have been handed down in the folk-lore of all nations.</p>

<p>Chapters 2-13, inclusive, appeared originally with
diagrams similar to those shown here, under the department
of Nature and Science for Young Folk in <cite>St.
Nicholas</cite> from May, 1921, to April, 1922, inclusive.
The Introductory Chapter and Chapters 14 and 15,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
on the Milky Way and Stars of the Southern Hemisphere,
respectively, are published here for the first time,
as is also the chapter in Part II on the Evolution of the
Stars from Red Giants to Red Dwarfs, which gives the
order of the evolution of the stars as now accepted as a
result of the brilliant astronomical researches of Dr.
Henry Norris Russell of the United States and Prof. A.
S. Eddington, of England.</p>

<p>The remaining chapters in Part II have been chosen
from a series of articles that have appeared in <cite>Science
and Invention</cite>, formerly <cite>The Electrical Experimenter</cite>,
in the past four years, and have been considerably
revised and in some parts rewritten to adapt them to the
understanding of more youthful readers. These chapters
deal with a variety of astronomical subjects of general
popular interest and an effort has been made to
select subjects that would cover as wide an astronomical
field as possible in a limited space.</p>

<p>The author's aim has not been to write a text-book
of astronomy or to treat in detail of any one aspect of
this extensive science, but simply to give the average
child some general knowledge of the nature of the heavenly
bodies, both those that form a part of our own
solar system and those that lie in the depths of space
beyond.</p>

<p>It has been necessary to write very briefly, and we
feel inadequately, of many topics of special interest
such as the sun and moon. Books have been written
on these two subjects alone as well as upon such subjects
as Mars, eclipses, comets, meteors, etc., but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
object has been to acquaint the child with the outstanding
features of a variety of celestial objects rather
than to treat of a few in detail.</p>

<p>If the writer succeeds in arousing the child's interest
in the stars so that he may look forth with intelligence
at the heavens and greet the stars as friends and
at the same time grasps some of the simplest and most
fundamental of astronomical truths such as the distinction
between stars and planets, the motions of the
heavenly bodies and their relative distances from us
and the place of our own planet-world in the universe,
this book will have served its purpose.</p>

<p>Who would not like to know the stars and constellations
by their names and in their seasons as we
know the birds and the trees and the flowers, to recognize
at their return, year by year, Sirius and Spica, Arcturus
and Antares, Vega and Altair, to know when Ursa
Major swings high overhead and Orion sinks to rest beneath
the western horizon, when Leo comes into view
in the east or the Northern Crown lies overhead?</p>

<p>Often we deprive ourselves of the pleasure of making
friends with the stars and shut our eyes to the glories
of the heavens above because we do not realize how
simple a matter it is to become acquainted with the
various groups of stars as they cross our meridian,
one by one, day after day and month after month in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the same orderly sequence. When the robin returns
once more to nest in the same orchard in the spring
time, Leo and Virgo may be seen rising above the
eastern horizon in the early evening hours. When the
first snow flies in the late fall and the birds have all
gone southward the belt of Orion appears in the east
and Cygnus dips low in the west. When we once
come to know brilliant blue-white Vega, ruddy Arcturus,
golden Capella and sparkling Sirius we watch
for them to return each in its proper season and greet
them as old friends.</p>

<p>In the following pages we give for each month the
constellations or star-groups that are nearest to our
meridian, that is, that lie either due north or due south
or exactly overhead in the early part of the month
and the early part of the evening.</p>

<p>We do not need to start our study of the constellations
in January. We may start at any month in the
year and we will find the constellations given for that
month on or near the meridian at the time indicated.</p>

<p>In using the charts or diagrams of the constellations,
we should hold them in an inverted position with the
top of the page toward the north or else remember
that the left-hand side of the page is toward the <em>east</em>
and the right-hand side of the page toward the <em>west</em>,
which is the opposite of the arrangement for charts
and maps of the earth's surface.</p>

<p>We should also bear in mind that the constellations
are all continually shifting westward for the stars
and the moon and the planets as well as the sun rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
daily in the east and set in the west. This is due
to the fact that the earth is turning in the opposite
direction on its axis, that is from west to east. In
twenty-four hours the earth turns completely around
with respect to the heavens or through an angle of
360°, so in one hour it turns through an angle of
360° ÷ 24 or 15°. As a result the stars appear to
shift westward 15° every hour. This is a distance
about equal in length to the handle of the Big Dipper,
which I am sure we all know, even if we do not
know another constellation in the heavens.</p>

<p>If, then, we look at the heavens at a later hour
than that for which the constellations are given we
will find them farther westward and if our time of
observation is earlier in the evening than the hour
mentioned we will find them farther eastward.</p>

<p>In the course of a year the earth makes one trip
around the sun and faces in turn all parts of the
heavens. That is, it turns through an angle of 360°
with respect to the heavens in a year or through an
angle of 360° ÷ 12 or 30° in one month. So as a
result of our revolution around the sun, which is also in
a west to east direction, we see that all the constellations
are gradually shifting westward at the rate of
30° a month. It is for this reason that we see different
constellations in different months, and it is because
of the turning of the earth on its axis that we see
different constellations at different hours of the night.</p>

<p>If we should sit up from sunset to sunrise and watch
the stars rise in the east, pass the meridian and set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
in the west&mdash;as the sun does by day&mdash;we should see
in turn the same constellations that are to pass across
the heavens in the next six months. This is because in
twelve hours' time we are carried through the same
angle with respect to the heavens by the earth's rotation
on its axis that we are in the next six months by
the motion of the earth around the sun.</p>

<p>Let us suppose then that the time we choose for our
observation of the heavens is the last of the month
while our charts are given for the first of the month.
We must look then farther westward for our constellations
just as we must look farther westward if
we chose a later hour in the evening for our observations.
Let us suppose that we choose for our time
of observation half-past eight in the early part of
December. On or close to the meridian we will find
the constellations outlined in the charts for December.
To the east of the meridian we will find the
constellations that are given for January and February,
and to the west of the meridian the constellations
that are given for November and October.
So if we are particularly ambitious or wish to become
acquainted with the constellations more rapidly
we may study at the same time the constellations for
the preceding months now west of the meridian and
the constellations for the following months now east
of the meridian as well as the constellations for the
month which will be due north or south or directly
overhead as the case may be.</p>

<p>If we were able to see the stars by day as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
by night we would observe that as the days go by
the sun is apparently moving continuously eastward
among certain constellations. This is a result of the
earth's actual motion around the sun in the same
direction.</p>

<p>The apparent path of the sun among the stars is
called the ecliptic and the belt of the heavens eight
degrees wide on either side of the ecliptic is called the
zodiac. The constellations that lie within this belt
of the zodiac are called zodiacal constellations. The
zodiac was divided by the astronomer Hipparchus, who
lived 161-126 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, into twelve signs 30° wide,
and the signs were named for the constellations lying
at that time within each of these divisions. These
zodiacal constellations are Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer,
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus,
Aquarius and Pisces. With the exception of
Libra, the Scales, all of these constellations are named
for people or animals and the word zodiac is derived
from the Greek word meaning "of animals."</p>

<p>Each month the sun moves eastward 30° through one
of these zodiacal constellations. In the days of Hipparchus
the sun was in Aries at the beginning of
spring, at the point where the ecliptic crosses the celestial
equator&mdash;which lies directly above the earth's equator.
This point where the ecliptic crosses the equator was
then known as the First Point in Aries. The autumnal
equinox was 180° distant in Aquarius and the two
points were called the equinoxes because when the sun
is at either equinox the day and night are equal in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
length all over the world. Now for certain reasons
which we will not explain here the equinoctial points
are not fixed in position but shift gradually westward
at the rate of 1° in 70 years. It is as if the equinoxes
were advancing each year to meet the sun on its
return and their westward motion is therefore called
"The Precession of the Equinoxes."</p>

<p>Since the days of Hipparchus this motion has
amounted to about 30° so that the constellations no
longer occupy the signs of the zodiac that bear their
names.</p>

<p>The sun is now in Pisces instead of Aries at the
beginning of spring and in Virgo instead of Aquarius
at the beginning of fall.</p>

<p>Not only the sun but the moon and planets as
well move through the zodiacal constellations. In
fact a limit for the zodiac of 8° on either side of
the ecliptic was chosen because it marks the extent of
the excursions of the moon and planets from the
ecliptic. Neither moon nor planets will be found at
a greater distance than 8° on either side of the
ecliptic.</p>

<p>For convenience in determining the positions of the
heavenly bodies the astronomer assumes that they lie
upon the surface of a celestial sphere that has its
center at the center of the earth.</p>

<p>The north pole of the celestial sphere lies directly
above the north pole of the earth and the south pole
of the celestial sphere directly above the south pole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of the earth. The celestial equator is the great circle
of the celestial sphere that lies midway between its
north and south poles and directly above the earth's
equator. The ecliptic is also a great circle of the
celestial sphere and cuts the celestial equator at an
angle of 23&frac12;° in the two points 180° apart known
as the equinoctial points, of which we have already
spoken.</p>

<p>The zodiacal constellations lie nearly overhead within
the tropics and can be seen to advantage all over the
world except in polar regions.</p>

<p>For every position of the earth's surface except at
the equator we have also our circumpolar constellations
which are the ones that never pass below the horizon
for the place of observation.</p>

<p>In 40° N. Latitude the Big Dipper is a circumpolar
constellation for it is above the horizon at all hours of
the day and night and all times of the year. If our
latitude is 40° N., all stars within 40° of the north
pole of the heavens are circumpolar and never set,
while stars within 40° of the south pole of the heavens
never rise. All other stars rise and set daily.</p>

<p>If we were at the north pole all stars within 90°
of the north pole of the heavens would be circumpolar
and would describe daily circuits of the pole parallel
to the horizon remaining always above it.</p>

<p>If we were at the equator all stars within <i>zero</i>
degrees of either pole would be circumpolar, that is <em>no</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
stars would be circumpolar, all stars rising and setting
daily.</p>

<p>As a general rule, then, we may say that stars within
an angular distance of the nearest pole of the heavens
equal to the latitude never set and stars within an equal
distance of the opposite pole never rise while all stars
outside of these limits rise and set daily.</p>

<p>The beginner who attempts to make the acquaintance
of the principal stars and constellations occasionally
may find a bright star in a constellation that is
not noted in the diagrams. In this case he has probably
happened upon one of the bright planets.</p>

<p>It is not possible to include the planets in our diagrams
for the reason that they are not fixed in position
but apparently wander among the stars. The name
planet is, in fact, derived from a Greek word meaning
"wanderer." The stars shine by their own light but
the planets shine only by reflected light from the sun.
Of the seven planets in the solar system additional to
our own planet earth, there are two, Uranus and
Neptune that we need not consider for Neptune is not
visible without the aid of a telescope and Uranus is
fainter than any of the stars included in our diagrams.</p>

<p>Mercury will never appear except in the morning or
evening twilight, when none but the very brightest
stars are visible, since it never departs far from the
sun. It will only be seen under certain favorable conditions,
and usually it will escape our notice altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
unless we know exactly where to look for it although
there are but two or three stars in the heavens that
surpass it in brightness.</p>

<p>Venus, we will probably never mistake for any star
in the heavens for it far surpasses all stars in brightness.
It will always be seen in the west after sunset
or in the east before sunrise and it is never seen more
than three hours before or after the sun.</p>

<p>This leaves us but three planets, Jupiter, Saturn and
Mars that we may mistake for bright stars. There is
little chance that Jupiter will be thus mistaken for
it also is far brighter than all of the stars except Sirius
which differs greatly from Jupiter in color. Sirius is
a brilliant white and Jupiter is a golden yellow. The
planets do not twinkle as the stars do and this is
particularly true of Jupiter which is remarkable for the
quiet steadiness of its yellow light. This alone would
serve to identify it.</p>

<p>Saturn is probably mistaken for a star oftener than
any of the other planets. It moves so slowly among
the stars that we would have to watch it for a number
of successive evenings before we could discover that
it is moving with respect to the stars. Saturn is yellowish
in color and we can probably best distinguish it
by the steadiness of its light. If we find in one of the
zodiacal groups of stars&mdash;for the planets appear among
no other constellations&mdash;a bright yellowish star where
no bright star is indicated on the diagram we may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
reasonably certain that we have found the planet Saturn.</p>

<p>Mars is the only planet that is reddish in color.
Once in fifteen or seventeen years, when it is particularly
near to the earth, it surpasses even Jupiter in brightness,
but ordinarily it appears no more brilliant than one
of the brighter stars. There are only two stars with
which we are likely to confuse Mars,&mdash;Aldebaran and
Antares&mdash;which are very similar to it in color, and, at
times, in brightness. Moreover, both of these stars
are zodiacal stars and Mars frequently passes through
the constellations to which they belong. There should
be no trouble about identifying Aldebaran and Antares,
however, from their distinctive positions in the diagrams
so that any other reddish star appearing in any
of the zodiacal groups we may feel certain is the
planet Mars.</p>

<p>In the following diagrams of the constellations the
brightest and most conspicuous stars, called first-magnitude
stars, are represented by white stars. These
are the stars we should all be able to recognize and call
by name and in every instance the name of a first-magnitude
star is given on the diagram. All other stars
are represented by circles, and the size of the circle is
an indication of the brightness of the star.</p>

<p>Stars visible without the aid of a telescope are
referred to usually as "naked-eye stars." They are
classed as first, second, third, four, fifth or sixth
magnitude stars, according to their relative brightness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
A star of the first magnitude is about two and one-half
times brighter than a star of the second magnitude,
which in turn is two and one-half times brighter than
a star of the third magnitude and so on. A first-magnitude
star is, then, one hundred times brighter than
a sixth magnitude star which is the faintest star that
can be seen without the aid of the telescope.</p>

<p>This ratio between successive magnitudes continues
among the telescopic stars. A star of the sixth
magnitude is one hundred times brighter than a star
of the eleventh magnitude which in turn is one hundred
times brighter than a star of the sixteenth magnitude.</p>

<p>The faintest stars that can be seen visually in the
greatest telescopes are of the seventeenth or eighteenth
magnitude, though stars two or three magnitudes
fainter can be photographed.</p>

<p>The faintest stars shown in the diagrams are fifth-magnitude
stars and stars of this magnitude as well
as stars of the fourth magnitude are only given when
needed to fill out the distinctive outlines of the constellations
which have been formed by connecting the
principal stars in each group by dotted lines.</p>

<p>All stars of first, second and third magnitude are
given in the diagrams without exceptions as such stars
are visible to everyone on clear nights.</p>

<p>The constellations given in the following pages include
practically all of the constellations that can be
seen in 40° N. Latitude. A diagram is given for each
constellation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>In this latitude it is impossible to see the constellations
of the southern hemisphere that lie within 40°
of the south pole of the heavens. A brief chapter
with diagram treats of these constellations that are
invisible in mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II">II</a><br /><br />

JANUARY</h2>


<p>One of the most easily recognized constellations in
the heavens is Taurus, The Bull, a zodiacal group
which lies just south of the zenith in our latitudes in
the early evening hours about the first of January.</p>

<p>Taurus is distinguished by the V-shaped group of
The Hyades, which contains the bright, red, first-magnitude
star Aldebaran, representing the fiery eye of
the bull. It also contains the famous cluster of faint
stars known as The Pleiades, lying a short distance
northwest of The Hyades.</p>

<p>No group of stars is more universally known than
The Pleiades. All tribes and nations of the world,
from the remotest days of recorded history up to the
present time, have sung the praises of The Pleiades.
They were "The Many Little Ones" of the Babylonians,
"The Seven Sisters" of the Greeks, "The Seven Brothers"
of the American Indians, "The Hen and Chickens"
of many nations of Europe, "The Little Eyes" of the
South Sea Islanders. They were honored in the religious
ceremonies of the Aztecs, and the savage tribes
of Australia danced in their honor. Many early tribes
of men began their year with November, the Pleiad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
month; and on November 17th, when The Pleiades
crossed the meridian at midnight, it was said that no
petition was ever presented in vain to the kings of
ancient Persia.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image016.jpg" width="400" height="387" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">January&mdash;Taurus</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Poets of all ages have felt the charm of The Pleiades.
Tennyson gives the following beautiful description of
The Pleiades in <cite>Locksley Hall</cite>:</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Many a night I saw the Pleiades, rising through the mellow shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glitter like a swarm of fireflies tangled in a silver braid."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p>A well-known astronomer, not so many years ago,
also felt the mysterious charm of The Pleiades and
seriously expressed the belief that Alcyone, the brightest
star of The Pleiades, was a central sun about which
all other suns were moving. But we know that there
is no foundation whatever for such a belief.</p>

<p>A fairly good eye, when the night is clear and dark,
will make out six stars in this group arranged in the
form of a small dipper. A seventh star lies close to
the star at the end of the handle and is more difficult
to find. It is called Pleione, and is referred to in
many legends as the lost Pleiad. Persons gifted with
exceptionally fine eyesight have made out as many as
eleven stars in the group; and with the aid of an ordinary
opera-glass, anyone can see fully one hundred
stars in this cluster. Astronomers have found that The
Pleiades cluster contains at least two hundred and fifty
stars, all drifting slowly in the same general direction
through space, and that the entire group is enveloped in
a fiery, nebulous mist which is most dense around the
brightest stars. It is not known whether the stars are
being formed from the nebula or whether the nebula is
being puffed off from the stars. The brightest star,
Alcyone, is at least two hundred times more brilliant
than our own sun, and all of the brighter stars in the
group surpass the sun many times in brightness. It
is believed that this cluster is so large that light takes
many years to cross from one end of it to the other,
and that it is so far from the earth that its light takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
over three centuries to reach us, traveling at the rate
of 186,000 miles a second.</p>

<p>The Hyades is a group of stars scarcely less famous
than The Pleiades, and the stars in the group also form
a moving cluster of enormous extent at a distance of
140 light-years from the earth.</p>

<p>Among the ancients, The Hyades were called the rain-stars,
and the word Hyades is supposed to come from
the Greek word for rain. Among the many superstitions
of the past was the belief that the rising or setting of
a group of stars with the sun had some special influence
over human affairs. Since The Hyades set just after
the sun in the showery springtime and just before sunrise
in the stormy days of late fall, they were always
associated with rain. In Tennyson's <cite>Ulysses</cite> we read:</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Through scudding drifts the rainy Hyades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vex'd the dim sea."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Hyades outline the forehead of Taurus, while
two bright stars some distance to the northeast of the
V form the tips of the horns. Only the head and forequarters
of the bull are shown in the star-atlases that
give the mythological groups, for, according to one
legend, he is swimming through the sea and the rest
of his body is submerged. According to another legend,
Taurus is charging down upon Orion, The Warrior,
represented by the magnificent constellation just to
the southeast of Taurus, of which we shall have more
to say next month.</p>

<p>Aldebaran is the Arabic word for "The Hindmost,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and the star is so called because it follows The Pleiades
across the sky. It is one of the most beautiful of all
the many brilliant stars visible at this time and we
might profit by following the advice of Mrs. Sigourney
in <cite>The Stars</cite>:</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">"Go forth at night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And talk with Aldebaran, where he flames<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the cold forehead of the wintry sky."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Next to Aldebaran in the V is the interesting double
star Theta, which we can see as two distinct stars
without a telescope.</p>

<p>Directly south of Taurus is Eridanus, sometimes
called Fluvius Eridanus, or The River Eridanus. Starting
a little to the southeast of Taurus, close to the
brilliant blue-white star Rigel in Orion, it runs to the
westward for a considerable distance in a long curving
line of rather faint stars, bends sharply southward for
a short distance, then curves backward toward the east
once more, and, after running for some distance, makes
another sharp curve to the southwest and disappears
below the southern horizon. Its course is continued far
into the southern hemisphere. Its brightest star,
Achernar, is a star of the first magnitude, but it lies
below the horizon in our latitudes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image020.jpg" width="400" height="380" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">January&mdash;Eridanus</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Eridanus contains no star of particular interest to
us. Most of the numerous stars that mark its course
are of the fourth and fifth magnitude. It contains but
two stars of the third magnitude, one at the beginning
of its course and one close to the southwestern horizon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
The beautiful constellation of Perseus lies just to the
north of Taurus and should rightfully be considered
among the constellations lying nearest to the meridian in
January, but we give this constellation among the star
groups for December because of its close association
with the nearby constellations Andromeda and Pegasus
in legend and story.</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III">III</a><br /><br />

FEBRUARY</h2>


<p>Across the meridian, due south, between eight and
nine o'clock in the evening in the early part of February,
lies Orion, The Warrior, generally considered
to be the finest constellation in the heavens. Orion
is directly overhead at the equator, and so is seen to
advantage from all parts of the world except the
extreme northern and southern polar regions.</p>

<p>A group of three faint stars outlines the head of
Orion. His right shoulder is marked by the deep-red,
first-magnitude star Betelgeuze (meaning armpit), and
his left shoulder by the bright white star Bellatrix,
The Amazon. Orion stands facing Taurus, The Bull,
and brandishes in his right hand a club, outlined by a
number of faint stars extending from Betelgeuze toward
the northeast. The top of the club lies near the tips
of the horns of Taurus. In his left hand he holds up a
lion's skin, which we can trace in another curving
line of faint stars to the west and northwest of Bellatrix.
The brilliant, blue-white, first-magnitude star
Rigel lies in the left foot, and the second-magnitude
star Saiph, a little to the east of Rigel, is in the right
knee. Three evenly spaced stars lying in a straight
line that is exactly three degrees in length form the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Belt of Orion, and from the Belt hangs the Sword of
Orion, outlined by three faint stars. The central star
in the Sword appears somewhat blurred and is the
multiple star Theta, in the midst of the great Orion
nebula, the finest object of its kind in the heavens.
Entangled in the meshes of this glowing nebula are a
number of brilliant suns, appearing to us as faint stars
because of their great distance. The star Theta, in
the heart of the nebula, is seen with a powerful telescope
to consist of six stars; that is, it is a sextuple star.
Even with a small telescope, four of these stars can
readily be seen, arranged in the form of a small trapezium.
The lowest star in the Sword is a triple
star, and the entire constellation abounds in double,
triple, and multiple stars.</p>

<p>From the central portion of the nebula extend many
branches and streamers of nebulous light, and it is
known that the entire constellation of Orion is enwrapped
in the folds of this nebulosity, which forms
a glowing, whirling mass of fiery gases in rapid rotation.
This constellation is remarkable for the fact that
all of its brighter stars, with the exception of the deep-red
Betelgeuze, form one enormous, connected group
of stars. They are all more or less associated with
the great nebula and its branches, and are all extremely
hot, white or bluish-white stars, known as helium
stars, because the gas helium is so conspicuous in their
atmospheres. The Orion stars are the hottest and
brightest of all the stars.</p>

<p>Blazing Rigel, Bellatrix, and Saiph, marking three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
corners of the great quadrilateral, of which Betelgeuze
marks the fourth corner, are all brilliant helium stars.
So are the three stars in the Belt and the fainter stars
in the Sword and the great nebula.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image023.jpg" width="400" height="392" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">February&mdash;Orion</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>It has been estimated that the great Orion group
of stars is over six hundred light-years from the earth,
or about forty million times more distant than the
sun. For more than six centuries the rays of light
that now enter our eyes from these stars have been
traveling through space with the speed of lightning.
So we see Orion not as it exists today, but as it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
six centuries ago. The extent of the Orion group
of stars is also inconceivably great. Even the central
part of the great nebula, which appears to our unaided
eyes only as a somewhat fuzzy star, would extend
from here to the nearest star and beyond, while our
entire solar system would be the merest speck in its
midst.</p>

<p>Betelgeuze, the red star that marks the right shoulder
of Orion, is, as we have said, not a member of the
Orion group. It has been estimated that it is about
two hundred light-years from the earth, or only
about one-third as far away as the other stars of the
constellation.</p>

<p>Betelgeuze very recently has attracted universal attention,
and will probably be considered an object of
historic interest in the future, because it is the first
star to have its diameter measured with the new
Michelson interferometer, which is now being used so
successfully to measure the diameters of the largest
stars. The truly sensational discovery has been made
that Betelgeuze is a supergiant of the universe, with a
diameter of about 275,000,000 miles. Our own sun,
which is known as a "dwarf" star, has a diameter of
864,000 miles. That is, Betelgeuze would make about
thirty million suns the size of our own. If placed at
the center of the solar system, it would fill all of the
space within the orbit of Mars; and the planets
Mercury, Venus, and the Earth would lie far beneath
its surface. Measurements of the diameters of other
giant stars which are now being made with the interferometer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
give results quite as startling as have been
obtained in the case of Betelgeuze; and it has been
found that several of these stars may even exceed Betelgeuze
in size. Such a star is Antares, the fiery-red
star in the heart of Scorpio, which is such a conspicuous
object in the summer evening skies. All these
huge stars are deep red in color, and some of them vary
irregularly in brightness. Betelgeuze is one of the
stars that changes in brightness in a peculiar manner
from time to time. <a name="star" id="star">When</a> shining with its greatest
brilliancy it is a brighter object than the nearby <ins title="Note: 'star' assumed in blank spot">star</ins>
Aldebaran, in Taurus; but a few months or a year later
it may lose so much of its light as to be decidedly
inferior to Aldebaran. We may note for ourselves
this remarkable change in the brightness of Betelgeuze
by comparing the two stars from time to time.</p>

<p>Directly south of Orion lies the small constellation
of Lepus, The Hare, which is made up of third-magnitude
and fourth-magnitude stars. The four
brighter stars are arranged in the form of a small, but
distinct, quadrilateral, or four-sided figure, which may
be easily seen in our latitudes. The small constellation
of Columba, The Dove, which lies just south of Lepus,
is so close to the horizon that it can not be seen to
advantage in the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere.
Neither Lepus nor Columba contain any object
of unusual interest.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image026.jpg" width="400" height="375" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">February&mdash;Auriga</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Due north of Orion, and lying in the zenith at this
time, is Auriga, The Charioteer, represented, strange
to say, with Capella, a goat, in his arms. The beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
first-magnitude star Capella, golden-yellow in color,
serves us in identifying the constellation. Close at hand
are The Kids, represented by a group of three faint
stars. Capella is one of the most brilliant stars of the
northern hemisphere. It is almost exactly equal in
brightness to Arcturus and Vega, stars conspicuous in
the summer months, and it is a shade brighter than
magnificent blue-white Rigel in Orion. Capella is
about fifty light-years distant from the earth and is
fully two hundred times more brilliant than our own
sun. At the distance of Capella, the sun would appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to be considerably fainter than any one of the three
stars in the nearby group of The Kids.</p>

<p>Capella is attended by a companion star so close to its
brilliant ruler that it can not be seen as a separate star
save with the aid of the most powerful telescopes. Its
distance from Capella has been very accurately measured,
however, by means of the interferometer, which
is giving us the measurements of the diameters of the
giant stars. It is known that this companion sun is
closer to Capella than our planet earth is to the sun.</p>

<p>At no time of the year shall we find near the meridian
so many brilliant and beautiful stars as appear in the
month of February at this time in the evening. In
addition to Capella, which is one of the three most
brilliant stars in the northern hemisphere of the
heavens, we have, in Orion alone, two stars of the
first magnitude, Betelgeuze and Rigel, and five stars
of the second magnitude, Bellatrix and Saiph and the
three stars in the Belt. In addition, we have not far
distant in the western sky, fiery Aldebaran in Taurus,
and close on the heel of Orion in the east, Sirius, the
brightest star in the heavens, in the constellation of
Canis Major, The Greater Dog, as well as the first-magnitude
star Procyon in Canis Minor, The Lesser
Dog. Of these two groups we shall have more to say
under the constellations for March.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="IV" id="IV">IV</a><br /><br />

MARCH</h2>


<p>To the southeast of Orion and almost due south at
eight o'clock in the evening on the first of March lies
the constellation of Canis Major, The Greater Dog,
containing Sirius, the Dog-star, which far surpasses
all other stars in the heavens in brilliancy.</p>

<p>Sirius lies almost in line with the three stars that
form the Belt of Orion. We shall not have the slightest
difficulty in recognizing it, owing to its surpassing
brilliancy as well as to the fact that it follows so
closely upon the heels of Orion.</p>

<p>Sirius is the Greek for "scorching" or "sparkling,"
and the ancients attributed the scorching heat of
summer to the fact that Sirius then rose with the
sun. The torrid days of midsummer they called the
"dog-days" for this reason, and we have retained the
expression to the present time. Since Sirius was
always associated with the discomforts of the torrid
season, it did not have an enviable reputation among
the Greeks. We find in Pope's translation of the <cite>Iliad</cite>
this reference to Sirius:</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Terrific glory! for his burning breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taints the red air with fever, plagues, and death."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<p>In Egypt, however, many temples were dedicated to
the worship of Sirius, for the reason that some five
thousand years ago it rose with the sun at the time of
the summer solstice, which marks the beginning of
summer, and heralded the approaching inundation of
the Nile, which was an occasion for great rejoicing
among the Egyptians. It was, therefore, called the
Nile Star and regarded by them with the greatest
reverence.</p>

<p>Sirius is an intensely white hydrogen star; but
owing to its great brilliancy and to the fact that it does
not attain a great height above the horizon in our latitudes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
its rays are greatly refracted or broken up by
the atmosphere, which is most dense near the horizon,
and as a result, it twinkles or scintillates more noticeably
than other stars and flashes the spectrum colors&mdash;chiefly
red and green&mdash;like a true "diamond in the
sky"&mdash;a magnificent object in the telescope.</p>

<p>Sirius is one of our nearest neighbors among the
stars. Only two stars are known to be nearer to the
solar system. Yet its light takes about eight and a half
years to flash with lightning speed across the great
intervening chasm. It is attended also by a very faint
star that is so lost in the rays of its brilliant companion
that it can only be found with the aid of a powerful
telescope. The two stars are separated by a distance
of 1,800,000,000 miles; that is they are about as far
apart as Neptune and the sun. They swing slowly
and majestically about a common center, called their
center of gravity, in a period of about forty-nine years.
So faint is the companion of Sirius that it is estimated
that twenty thousand such stars would be needed to
give forth as much light as Sirius. The two stars
together, Sirius and its companion, give forth twenty-six
times as much light as our own sun. They weigh
only about three times as much, however. The companion
of Sirius, in spite of its extreme faintness,
weighs fully half as much as the brilliant star.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">March&mdash;Canis Major</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>There are a number of bright stars in the constellation
of Canis Major. A fairly bright star a little to
the west of Sirius marks the uplifted paw of the dog,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and to the southeast, in the tail and hind quarters, are
several conspicuous stars of the second magnitude.</p>

<p>A little to the east and much farther to the north,
we find Canis Minor, The Lesser Dog, containing the
beautiful first-magnitude star Procyon, "Precursor of
the Dog"&mdash;that is, of Sirius. Since Procyon is so
much farther north than Sirius and very little to the
east, we see its brilliant rays in the eastern sky some
time before Sirius appears above the southeastern
horizon, hence its name. Long after Sirius has disappeared
from view beneath the western horizon in the
late spring, Procyon may still be seen low in the
western sky. Procyon, also is one of our nearer
neighbors among the stars, being only about ten light-years
distant from the solar system. Like Sirius, it
is a double star with a much fainter companion, that
by its attraction sways the motion of Procyon to such
an extent that we should know of its existence, even
if it were not visible, by the disturbances it produces
in the motion of Procyon. The period of revolution of
Procyon and its companion about a common center is
about forty years, and the two stars combined weigh
about a third more than our own sun and give forth
six times as much light. Canis Minor contains only
one other bright star, Beta, a short distance to the
northwest of Procyon. Originally, the name Procyon
was given to the entire constellation, but it was later
used only with reference to the one star. Procyon,
Sirius, and Betelgeuze in Orion form a huge equal-sided
triangle that lies across the meridian at this time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and is a most conspicuous configuration in the evening
sky.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">March&mdash;Gemini and Canis Minor</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Directly south of the zenith we find Gemini, The
Twins, one of the zodiacal constellations. It is in
Gemini that the sun is to be found at the beginning of
summer. The two bright stars Castor and Pollux
mark the heads of the twins, and the two stars in the
opposite corners of the four-sided figure shown in the
chart mark their feet.</p>

<p>Castor and Pollux, according to the legend, were
the twin brothers of Helen of Troy who went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the Argonautic expedition. When a storm overtook
the vessel on its return voyage, Orpheus invoked the
aid of Apollo, who caused two stars to shine above
the heads of the twins, and the storm immediately
ceased. It was for this reason that Castor and Pollux
became the special deities of seamen, and it was customary
to place their effigies upon the prows of vessels.
The "By Jimini!" of today is but a corruption of
the "By Gemini!" heard so frequently among the sailors
of the ancient world.</p>

<p>The astronomical name for Castor, the fainter star,
is Alpha Geminorum, meaning Alpha of Gemini. As
it was customary to call the brightest star in a constellation
by the first letter in the Greek alphabet, it
is believed that Castor has decreased considerably in
brightness since the days of the ancients, for it is now
decidedly inferior to Pollux in brightness, which is
called Beta Geminorum. Of the two stars, Castor is
the more interesting because it is a double star that
is readily separated into two stars with the aid of a
small telescope. The two principal stars are known to
be, in turn, extremely close double stars revolving almost
in contact in periods of a few days. Where we
see but one star with the unaided eye, there is, then
a system of four suns, the two close pairs revolving
slowly about a common center of gravity in a period
of several centuries and at a great distance apart.</p>

<p>The star Pollux, which we can easily distinguish by
its superior brightness, is the more southerly of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
twin stars and lies due north of Procyon and about as
far from Procyon as Procyon is from Sirius.</p>

<p>The appearance of Gemini on the meridian in the
early evening and of the huge triangle, with its corners
marked by the brilliants, Procyon, Sirius, and Betelgeuze,
due south, with "Great Orion sloping slowly
to the west," is as truly a sign of approaching spring
as the gradual lengthening of the days, the appearance
of crocuses and daffodils, and the first robin. It is
only a few weeks later&mdash;as pictured by Tennyson in
<cite>Maud</cite>&mdash;</p>

APRIL</h2>


<p>In the early evening hours of April the western sky
is still adorned with the brilliant jewels with which
we became familiar on the clear frosty evenings of
winter. Orion is now sinking fast to his rest beneath
the western horizon. Beautiful, golden Capella in
Auriga glows in the northwest. Sirius sparkles and
scintillates, a magnificent diamond of the sky, just
above the southwestern horizon, while Procyon in
Canis Minor, The Lesser Dog, and Castor and Pollux,
The Twins, in the constellation of Gemini, are still
high in the western part of the heavens.</p>

<p>In the northeast and east may be seen the constellations
that will be close to the meridian at this
time next month. Ursa Major, The Greater Bear,
with its familiar Big Dipper, is now in a favorable
position for observation. The Sickle in Leo is high in
the eastern sky, and Spica, the brilliant white diamond
of the evening skies of spring, is low in the southeast
in Virgo.</p>

<p>Near the meridian this month we find between Auriga
and Ursa Major, and east of Gemini, the inconspicuous
constellation of Lynx, which contains not a single
bright star and is a modern constellation devised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
simply to fill the otherwise vacant space in circumpolar
regions between Ursa Major and Auriga.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image036.jpg" width="400" height="398" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">April&mdash;Cancer</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Just south of the zenith at this time, and lying
between Gemini and Leo, is Cancer, The Crab, the
most inconspicuous of all the zodiacal constellations.
There are no bright stars in this group, and there is
also nothing distinctive about the grouping of its
faint stars, though we can readily find it, from its
position between the two neighboring constellations
of Gemini and Leo by reference to the chart.</p>

<p>In the position indicated there we will see on clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
evenings a faint, nebulous cloud of light, which is
known as Praesepe, The Beehive, or as The Manger,
the two faint stars flanking it on either side being
called Aselli, The Asses. This faint cloud can be
easily resolved by an opera-glass into a coarse cluster
of stars that lie just beyond the range of the unaided
human vision.</p>

<p>To the ancients, Praesepe served as an indicator of
weather conditions, and Aratus, an ancient astronomer,
wrote of this cluster:</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A murky manger, with both stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shining unaltered, is a sign of rain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If while the northern ass is dimmed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By vaporous shroud, he of the south gleam radiant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Expect a south wind; the vaporous shroud and radiance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exchanging stars, harbinger Boreas."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This was not entirely a matter of superstition, as we
might possibly imagine, for the dimness of the cluster
is simply an indication that vapor is gathering and
condensing in the atmosphere, just as a ring around
the moon is an indication of the same gathering and
condensation of vapor that precedes a storm.</p>

<p>Some centuries ago the sun reached its greatest
distance north of the equator&mdash;which occurs each year
at the beginning of summer&mdash;at the time when it
was passing through the constellation of Cancer. Our
tropic of Cancer, which marks the northern limit of
the torrid zone, received its name from this fact. At
the time when the sun reaches the point farthest north,
its height above the horizon changes very little from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
day to day, and for a short time it appears to be
slowly crawling sideways through the heavens, as a
crab walks, and for this reason, possibly, the constellation
was called Cancer, The Crab. At the present
time the "Precession of the Equinoxes," or westward
shifting of the vernal equinox&mdash;the point where the
sun crosses the equator going north in the spring&mdash;brings
the sun, when it is farthest north, in Gemini
instead of in Cancer. At the present time, then it
would be more accurate to speak of the tropic of
Gemini, though this in turn would be inaccurate after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
a lapse of centuries, as the sun passed into another constellation
at the beginning of summer. The tropic of
Capricorn, which marks the farthest southern excursions
of the sun in its yearly circuit of the heavens,
should also more appropriately be called the tropic
of Sagittarius, as the sun is now in Sagittarius instead
of Capricornus at the time when it is farthest south,
though the point is slowly shifting westward into
Scorpio.</p>

<p>Mythology tells us that Cancer was sent by Juno to
distract Hercules by pinching his toes while he was
contending with the many-headed serpent in the Lernean
swamp. Hercules, the legend says, crushed the
crab with a single blow, and Juno by way of reward
placed it in the heavens.</p>

<p>In Cancer, according to the belief of the Chaldeans,
was located the "gate of men," by which souls
descended into human bodies, while in Capricornus
was the "gate of the gods," through which the freed
souls of men returned to heaven.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">April&mdash;Hydra</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Hydra, the many-headed serpent with which Hercules
contended, is represented by a constellation of
great length. It extends from a point just south of
Cancer, where a group of faint stars marks the heads,
to the south and southeast in a long line of faint
stars. It passes in its course just south of Crater and
Corvus, the two small star-groups below Leo (see
constellations for May), which are sometimes called
its riders, and it also stretches below the entire length
of the long, straggling constellation of Virgo. At this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
time we can trace it only to the point where it disappears
below the horizon in the southeast. It contains
but one bright star, Alphard, or Cor Hydrae as
it is also called, standing quite alone and almost due
south at this time. Hydra, as well as Lynx and Cancer,
contains no noteworthy or remarkable object and consists
chiefly of faint stars. Alphard is, in fact, the
only bright star that we have in the constellations for
this month. It chances that these three inconspicuous
star-groups, Lynx, Crater, and Hydra, lie nearest to
the meridian at this time, separating the brilliant groups
of winter from those of the summer months.</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI">VI</a><br /><br />

MAY</h2>


<p>Ursa Major, the Great Bear, and Ursa Minor, the
Lesser Bear, or, as they are more familiarly called,
the Big Dipper and the Little Dipper, are the best
known of all the constellations visible in northern latitudes.
They are called circumpolar constellations, which
means "around the pole." For those who live north of
40° N. Lat. they never set, but can be seen at all hours
of the night and at all times of the year. In fall and
winter evenings Ursa Major lies below the pole and
near the horizon, and so is usually hidden more or
less from view by trees or buildings. It is during the
early evening hours of late spring and summer that
this constellation is seen to the best advantage high in
the sky above the pole. If one looks due north at
the time mentioned, it will be impossible to miss either
of these constellations.</p>

<p>To complete the outline of the Great Bear, it is necessary
to include faint stars to the east, which form the
head of the Bear, and other faint stars to the south,
which form the feet, but these are all inconspicuous
and of little general interest.</p>

<p>The two stars in the bowl of the Big Dipper
through which an arrow is drawn in the chart, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
called the Pointers, because an imaginary line drawn
through these two stars and continued a distance about
equal to the length of the Big Dipper, brings us to
the star Polaris, or the North Star, at the end of the
handle of the Little Dipper, which is very close to
the north pole of the heavens, the direction in which
the earth's axis points. The pole lies on the line connecting
the star at the bend in the handle of the Big
Dipper with Polaris, and is only one degree distant
from the pole-star.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image042.jpg" width="400" height="366" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">May&mdash;Ursa Major and Ursa Minor</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The distance between the Pointers is five degrees of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
arc, and the distance from the more northerly of these
two stars to Polaris is nearly thirty degrees. We may
find it useful to remember this in estimating distances
between objects in the heavens, which are always given
in angular measure.</p>

<p>A small two and one-half inch telescope will separate
Polaris into two stars eighteen seconds of arc apart.
The companion star is a faint white star of the ninth
magnitude.</p>

<p>Twenty years or so ago it was discovered with the
aid of the spectroscope that the brighter of the two
stars was also a double star, but the two stars were
so close together that they could not be seen as separate
stars in any telescope. Later it was found that
the brighter star was in reality triple, that is, it consists
of three suns close together. The faint white
companion star formed with these three suns a system
of four suns revolving about a common center of gravity.
Still more recently it has been discovered that the
brightest of these four suns varies regularly in brightness
in a period of a little less than four days. It belongs
to the important class of stars known as Cepheid
variable stars, whose changes of light, it is believed,
are produced by some periodic form of disturbance
taking place within the stars themselves.</p>

<p>With one exception, Polaris is the nearest to the
earth of all these Cepheid variable stars, which are in
most instances at very great distances from the solar
system. The latest measurements of the distance of
Polaris show that its light takes about two centuries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to travel to the earth, or, in other words, that it is
distant two hundred light-years.</p>

<p>Like all Cepheid variables, Polaris is a giant star. It
gives forth about five hundred and twenty-five times
as much light as our own sun. If Polaris and the sun
were placed side by side at a distance of thirty-three
light-years, the sun would appear as a star of the fifth
magnitude, just well within the range of visibility of
the human eye, while Polaris would outshine Sirius, the
brightest star in the heavens.</p>

<p>As a practical aid to navigators, Polaris is unsurpassed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
in importance by any star of the northern hemisphere
of the heavens. At the equator the pole-star
lies in the horizon; at the north pole of the earth it
is in the zenith or directly overhead. Its altitude or
height above the horizon is always equal to the latitude
of the place of observation. As we travel northward
from the equator toward the pole we see Polaris rise
higher and higher in the sky. In New York the elevation
of Polaris above the horizon is forty degrees,
which is the latitude of the city.</p>

<p>The Pointers indicate the direction of Polaris and
the true north, while the height of Polaris above the
horizon tells us our latitude. These kindly stars direct us
by night when we are uncertain of our bearings, whether
we travel by land or sea or air. They are the friends
and aids of explorers, navigators and aviators, who
often turn to them for guidance.</p>

<p>Bryant writes thus beautifully of Polaris in his
<cite>Hymn to the North Star</cite>:</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Constellations come and climb the heavens, and go.<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p>The star at the bend in the handle of the Big Dipper,
called Mizar, is of special interest. If one has good eyesight,
he will see close to it a faint star. This is Alcor,
which is Arabic for The Test. The two stars are
also called the Horse and the Rider.</p>

<p>Mizar forms with Alcor what is known as a wide
double star. It is, in fact, the widest of all double
stars. Many stars in the heavens that appear single
to us are separated by the telescope into double or
triple or multiple stars. They consist of two or more
suns revolving about a common center, known as their
center of gravity. Sometimes the suns are so close
together that even the most powerful telescope will not
separate them. Then a most wonderful little instrument,
called the spectroscope, steps in and analyzes the
light of the stars and shows which are double and which
are single. A star shown to be double by the spectroscope,
but not by the telescope, is called a spectroscopic
binary star.</p>

<p>Mizar is of historic interest, as being the first double
star to be detected with the aid of the telescope. A
very small telescope will split Mizar up into two stars.
The brighter of the two is a spectroscopic binary star
beside, so that it really consists of two suns instead
of one, with the distance between the two so
small that even the telescope cannot separate them.
About this system of three suns which we know as
the star Mizar, the faint star Alcor revolves at a distance
equal to sixteen thousand times the distance of
the earth from the sun.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">May&mdash;Leo</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>If we follow the imaginary line drawn through the
Pointers in a <em>southerly</em> direction about forty-five degrees,
we come to Leo, The Lion, one of the zodiacal
constellations. There should be no difficulty in finding
the constellation Leo, as its peculiar sickle-shaped group
of bright stars makes it distinctive from all other constellations.
At the time we have mentioned, that is,
the early evening hours, it will lie a little to the southwest
of the zenith. Leo is one of the finest constellations
and is always associated with the spring months
because it is then high in the sky in the evening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Regulus is the beautiful white star which marks the
handle of The Sickle, and the heart of Leo; and Denebola
is the second-magnitude star in the tail of Leo.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">May&mdash;Corvus and Crater</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Due south of Denebola, about thirty degrees, we find
the small star-group known as Crater, The Cup, which
is composed of rather faint and inconspicuous stars.
Just east of Crater is the group known as Corvus, The
Crow, which forms a very characteristic little four-sided
figure of stars differing very little from one another
in brightness. These two star groups lie far
to the south in our latitudes; but if we lived twenty degrees
south of the equator, we would find them nearly
overhead, at this time of the year. Just south of
Corvus and Crater we find Hydra, one of the constellations
for April which extends beneath these constellations
and also beneath Virgo, one of the June constellations.</p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII">VII</a><br /><br />

JUNE</h2>


<p>The star-groups that occupy the center of the celestial
stage in mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere
during the early evening hours of June are Boötes,
often called The Hunter, (although the word means
Herdsman or Shouter), which will be found overhead
at this time; Virgo, The Maiden, largest of the zodiacal
constellations, lying nearly due south; Canes Venatici,
The Hunting Dogs; Corona Borealis, The Northern
Crown, and Coma Berenices.</p>

<p>The gorgeous orange-hued Arcturus in Boötes and
the beautiful bluish-white Spica in Virgo, like a diamond
in its sparkling radiance, form with Denebola in
Leo, which we identified in May, a huge equal-sided
triangle that is always associated with the spring and
early summer months.</p>

<p>To the west of Boötes, below the handle of the Big
Dipper, is a region where there are few conspicuous
stars. Here will be found Canes Venatici (The Hunting
Dogs with which Boötes is supposed to be pursuing
the Great Bear around the north pole), and, further
south, Coma Berenices (Bernice's Hair).</p>

<p>The brighter of the two Hunting Dogs, which is also
the brightest star in the entire region covered by these
two constellations, appears as a beautiful blue-and-yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
double star in the telescope. It was named Cor Caroli
(Heart of Charles) by the astronomer Halley in honor
of Charles II of England, at the suggestion of the
court physician, who imagined it shone more brightly
than usual the night before the return of Charles to
London. Of more interest to astronomers is the magnificent
spiral nebula in this constellation, known as
the "Whirlpool Nebula," appearing as a faint, luminous
patch in the sky, of which many photographs have been
taken with the great telescopes. This entire region,
from Canes Venatici to Virgo, abounds in faint spiral
nebulæ that for some reason not yet understood by
astronomers are crowded together in this part of the
heavens where stars are comparatively few. It is believed
that there are between five hundred thousand and
a million of these spiral nebulæ in the entire heavens,
and the problem of their nature and origin and distance
is one that the astronomers are very anxious to
solve. Many wonderful facts are now being learned
concerning these faint nebulous wisps of light which,
with a few exceptions, are observable only with great
telescopes. They reveal their spiral structure more
clearly to the photographic plate than to the human
eye, and some magnificent photographs of them have
been taken with powerful telescopes.</p>

<p>Coma Berenices, south of Canes Venatici and southwest
of Boötes, is a constellation that consists of a
great number of stars closely crowded together, and
just barely visible to the unaided eye. As a result, it
has the appearance of filmy threads of light, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
doubtless suggested its name to the imaginative ancients,
who loved to fill the heavens with fanciful creations
associated with their myths and legends. These
stars form a moving cluster of stars estimated to be
at a distance of about 270 light-years from the solar
systems.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">June&mdash;Boötes, Canes Venatici and Coma Berenicis</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>This region, so lacking in interesting objects for the
naked-eye observer, is a mine of riches to the fortunate
possessors of telescopes; and the great telescopes of the
world are frequently pointed in this direction, exploring
the mysteries of space that abound here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Just to the east of Boötes is the exquisite little circlet
of stars known as Corona Borealis, the Northern Crown.
It consists of six stars arranged in a nearly perfect
semicircle, and one will have no difficulty in recognizing
it. Its brightest star, Alpha, known also by the
name of Alphacca, is a star of the second magnitude.</p>

<p>Boötes is one of the largest and finest of the northern
constellations. It can be easily distinguished by its
peculiar kite-shaped grouping of stars or by the conspicuous
pentagon (five-sided figure) of stars which it
contains. The most southerly star in this pentagon is
known as Epsilon Boötes and is one of the finest double
stars in the heavens. The two stars of which it consists
are respectively orange and greenish-blue in color.</p>

<p>By far the finest object in Boötes, however, is the
magnificent Arcturus, which is the brightest star in the
northern hemisphere of the heavens. This star will
be conspicuous in the evening hours throughout the
summer months, as will also the less brilliant Spica in
Virgo.</p>

<p>Some recent measurements show that Arcturus is
one of our nearer neighbors among the stars. Its distance
is now estimated to be about twenty-one light-years.
That is, a ray of light from this star takes
twenty-one years to reach the earth, traveling at the rate
of one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles per
second. It would seem as if we should hardly speak of
Arcturus, twenty-one light-years away, as a near neighbor,
yet there are millions of stars that are far more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
distant from the earth, and very few that are nearer
to us than Arcturus.</p>

<p>The brightness of Arcturus is estimated to be about
forty times that of the sun. That is, if the two
bodies were side by side, Arcturus would give forth
forty times as much light and heat as the sun.</p>

<p>Arcturus is also one of the most rapidly moving stars
in the heavens. In the past sixteen centuries it has
traveled so far as to have changed its position among
the other stars by as much as the apparent width of
the moon. Most of the stars, in spite of their motions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
through the heavens in various directions, appear today
in the same relative positions in which they were
several thousand years ago. It is for this reason that
the constellations of the Egyptians and of the Greeks
and Romans are the same constellations that we see
in the heavens today. Were all the stars as rapidly
moving as Arcturus, the distinctive forms of the constellations
would be preserved for only a very few
centuries.</p>

</div>

<p>Virgo, which lies south and southwest of Boötes, is
a large, straggling constellation, consisting of a Y-shaped
configuration of rather inconspicuous stars. It lies in
the path of our sun, moon and planets, and so is one
of the zodiacal constellations. The cross in the diagram
indicates the present position of the autumnal
equinox, the point where the sun crosses the equator
going south, and the position the sun now occupies
at the beginning of fall.</p>

<p>Spica, the brightest star in Virgo, is a bluish-white,
first-magnitude star, standing very much alone in the
sky. In fact, the Arabs referred to this star as "The
Solitary One." Its distance from the earth is not
known, but must be very great as it cannot be found
by the usual methods. The spectroscope shows that
it consists of two suns very close together, revolving
about a common center in a period of only four days.</p>

<p>Within the branches of the "Y" in Virgo, and just
to the north of it, is the wonderful nebulous region of
this constellation, but it takes a powerful telescope to
show the faint spiral nebulæ that exist here in great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
profusion. All of these spirals are receding from the
plane of the Milky Way with enormous velocities. The
spiral nebulæ are, in fact, the most rapidly moving
objects in the heavens.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII">VIII</a><br /><br />

JULY</h2>


<p>Due east of the little circlet of stars known as
Corona Borealis, and almost directly overhead
in our latitude (40° N.) about nine o'clock in the evening
in the early part of July, is the large constellation
of Hercules, named for the famous hero of Grecian
mythology. There are no stars of great brilliancy in
this group, but it contains a large number of fairly
bright stars arranged in the form outlined in the chart.
The hero is standing with his head, marked by the
star Alpha Herculis, toward the south, and his foot
resting on the head of Draco, The Dragon, a far-northern
constellation with which we become acquainted in
August.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">July&mdash;Hercules</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Alpha Herculis, the best known star in this constellation,
is of unusual interest. Not only is it a
most beautiful double star, the brighter of the two
stars of which it is composed being orange, and the
fainter greenish-blue, but it is also a star that changes
in brightness irregularly. Both the orange and the blue
star share in this change of brightness. There are a
number of stars in the heavens that vary in brightness,
some in very regular periods, and others, like
Alpha Herculis, irregularly. These latter stars are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
nearly always deep orange or reddish in color. One
may note this variation in the brightness of Alpha Herculis
by comparing it from time to time with some
nearby star that does not vary in brightness.</p>

<p class="center">Taken with 60-inch Reflector of the Mt. Wilson Observatory</p></div>
</div>

<p>The constellation of Hercules is a very rich field
for the possessor of even a small telescope. Here are
to be found beautifully colored double stars in profusion,
and, in addition, two remarkable clusters of
stars. The brighter of the two is known as the Great
Hercules Cluster. Its position is shown on the chart,
and, under favorable conditions&mdash;that is, on a clear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
dark night, when there is no moonlight&mdash;it may be
seen without the aid of a telescope as a small, faint
patch of light. One would never suspect from such a
view what a wonderful object this cluster becomes
when seen with the aid of a powerful telescope. Photographs
taken with the great telescopes show this faint
wisp of light as a magnificent assemblage of thousands
of stars, each a sun many times more brilliant than
our own sun. The crowded appearance of the stars
in the cluster is due partly to the fact that it is very
distant from the earth, though neighboring stars in
the cluster are indeed much nearer to one another than
are the stars in the vicinity of our solar system. It
has been found that this cluster is so far away that
its light takes over thirty-six thousand years to reach
the earth. At the distance of this cluster, a sun equal
in brightness to our own sun would be so faint that the
most powerful telescope in the world would not show
it. So we know that the stars that are visible in the
Hercules cluster are far more brilliant than our sun.
A fair-sized telescope will show about four thousand
stars in this cluster, but the greatest telescopes show
over one hundred thousand in it, and there are without
doubt many more too faint to be seen at all. The
Hercules cluster is called a globular star-cluster, because
the stars in it are arranged nearly in the form
of a sphere. There are in the heavens about ninety
such clusters whose distances have been found, and they
are among the most distant of all objects. Most of
them are very faint, and a few are over two hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
thousand light-years distant from the earth. The Hercules
cluster is one of the nearest and is the most noted of all of
these globular clusters. It is considered to be one of the
finest objects in the heavens. The other cluster in Hercules
is also very fine, but not to be compared with
this one.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image059.jpg" width="400" height="358" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">July&mdash;Ophiuchus and Serpens</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Just to the south of Hercules are two constellations,
Ophiuchus, The Serpent-Bearer, and Serpens, The Serpent,
which are so intermingled that it is difficult to distinguish
them. There are in these two constellations,
as in Hercules, no stars of unusual brilliancy, but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
large number of fairly bright stars. The brightest star
in Ophiuchus is known as Alpha Ophiuchi and it marks
the head of the Serpent-Bearer. The two stars, Alpha
Ophiuchi and Alpha Herculis, are close together, being
separated by a distance about equal to that between the
Pointers of the Big Dipper. Alpha Ophiuchi is the
brighter of the two, and it is farther east.</p>

<p>Ophiuchus, according to one legend, was once a
physician on earth, and was so successful as a healer
that he could raise the dead. Pluto, the god of the
lower world, became alarmed for fear his kingdom
would become depopulated, and persuaded Jupiter to
remove Ophiuchus to a heavenly abode, where he would
be less troublesome. The serpent is supposed to be a
symbol of his healing powers. The head of Serpens
is marked by a group of faint stars just south of
Corona Borealis and southwest of Hercules. From here
a line of fairly bright stars marks the course of Serpens
southward to the hand of Ophiuchus. Two stars
close together and nearly equal in brightness mark the
hand with which the hero grasps the body of the serpent.
The other hand is marked by an equally bright
single star some distance to the eastward where the
two constellations again meet. Ophiuchus is thus represented
as holding the serpent with both hands. It
is not an easy matter to make out the outlines of these
straggling groups, but there are in them several pairs
of stars nearly equal in brightness and about as evenly
spaced as the two stars in the one hand of Ophiuchus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and these, as well as the diagram, will be of aid in
tracing the two groups.</p>

<p>Just south of Serpens and Ophiuchus lies one of the
most beautiful and easily recognized constellations in
the heavens. This is the constellation of Scorpio, The
Scorpion, which will be found not far above the southern
horizon at this time. The small constellation of
Libra, The Scales, which lies just to the northwest of
Scorpio, was at one time a part of this constellation
and represented the creature's claws, but some centuries
ago its name was changed to Libra. Both
Scorpio and Libra are numbered among the twelve
zodiacal constellations&mdash;that is, they lie along the ecliptic,
or apparent yearly path of the sun among the stars.
Scorpio is the most brilliant and interesting of all the
zodiacal groups. The heart of the Scorpion is marked
by the magnificent first-magnitude star Antares, which
is of a deep reddish color. The name signifies Rival
of Ares (Mars). It is so called because it is the one
star in the heavens that most closely resembles Mars,
and it might be mistaken for the ruddy planet if one
were not familiar with the constellations. At times,
when Mars is at a considerable distance from the
earth, it is almost equal in brightness and general appearance
to this glowing red star in the heart of the
Scorpion. In its trips around the sun, Mars passes
occasionally very close to Antares, and the two then
present a very striking appearance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image062.jpg" width="400" height="370" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">July&mdash;Libra and Scorpio</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>With a telescope of medium size, one will find an
exquisite little green companion-star close to Antares.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
The little companion is so close to Antares that it is
difficult to find it in the glare of light from its more
brilliant neighbor. Antares is one of the giant stars
of the universe. In fact it is, so far as we know, the
greatest of all the giants. Its diameter is more than
five hundred times that of our own sun and nearly
twice that of the giant star Betelgeuze in Orion. If
placed at the center of the solar system its surface
would lie far beyond the orbit of Mars.</p>

<p>Both Ophiuchus and Scorpio are crossed by the
Milky Way, that broad belt of numberless faint stars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
that encircles the heavens. Some of the most wonderful
and beautiful regions of the Milky Way are to be
found in these two constellations.</p>

<p>At various times in the past, there have suddenly
flashed forth brilliant stars in the Milky Way which are
known as "temporary stars," or "novæ." These outbursts
signify that some celestial catastrophe has taken
place, the nature or cause of which is not clearly understood.
Some of the most brilliant of these outbursts
have occurred in these two constellations. The life of
a nova is very short, a matter of a few months, and it
rapidly sinks into oblivion, so nothing is to be seen of
some of the most brilliant of all these stars that have
appeared in this region in the past. A few are still
faintly visible in large telescopes.</p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX">IX</a><br /><br />

AUGUST</h2>


<p>It was one of the twelve labors of Hercules, the
hero of Grecian mythology, to vanquish the dragon
that guarded the golden apples in the garden of the
Hesperides. Among the constellations for July we
found the large group of stars that represents the hero
himself, and this month we find just to the north of
Hercules the head of Draco, The Dragon. The foot of
the hero rests upon the dragon's head, which is outlined
by a group of four fairly bright stars forming a quadrilateral
or four-sided figure. The brightest star in this
group passes in its daily circuit of the pole almost
through the zenith of London. That is, as it crosses
the meridian of London, it is almost exactly overhead.
From the head of Draco, the creature's body can be
traced in a long line of stars curving first eastward,
then northward, toward the pole-star to a point above
Hercules, where it bends sharply westward. The body
of the monster lies chiefly between its head and the bowl
of the Little Dipper. The tail extends in a long line
of faint stars midway between the two Dippers, or the
constellations of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, the tip
of the tail lying on the line connecting the Pointers
of the Big Dipper with the pole-star Polaris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Draco, as well as Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, is a circumpolar
constellation in our latitude; that is, it makes
its circuit of the pole without at any time dipping below
the horizon in latitudes north of 40°. It is, therefore,
visible at all hours of the night in mid-latitudes
of the northern hemisphere, but is seen to the best
advantage during the early evening hours in the summer
months. There are no remarkable stars in this constellation
with the exception of Alpha, which lies halfway
between the bowl of the Little Dipper and Mizar,
the star at the bend in the handle of the Big Dipper.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">August&mdash;Draco and Lyra</span></p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>About four thousand seven hundred years ago, this
star was the pole-star&mdash;lying even nearer to what was
then the north pole of the heavens than Polaris does to
the present position of the pole. The sun and moon
exert a pull on the bulging equatorial regions of the
earth, which tends to draw the plane of the earth's
equator down into the plane of the ecliptic. This
causes the "Precession of the Equinoxes" and at the
same time a slow revolution of the earth's axis of rotation
about the pole of the ecliptic. The north pole
of the heavens as a result describes a circle about the
pole of the ecliptic of radius 23&frac12;° in a period of
25,800 years.</p>

<p>Each bright star that lies near the circumference of
this circle becomes in turn the pole-star sometime within
this period. The star Alpha, in Draco, had its turn
at being pole-star some forty-seven centuries ago.
Polaris is now a little over a degree from the north
pole of the heavens. During the next two centuries
it will continue to approach the pole until it comes
within a quarter of a degree of it, when its distance
from the pole will begin to increase again. About
twelve thousand years hence the magnificent Vega,
whose acquaintance we will now make, will be the
most brilliant and beautiful of all pole-stars.</p>

<p>Vega (Arabic for "Falling Eagle") is the resplendent,
bluish-white, first-magnitude star that lies in the constellation
of Lyra, The Lyre or Harp, a small, but important,
constellation just east of Hercules and a little
to the southeast of the head of Draco. Vega is almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
exactly equal in brightness to Arcturus, the orange-colored
star in Boötes, now lying west of the meridian
in the early evening hours. It is also a near neighbor
of the solar system, its light taking something like forty
years to travel to the earth. Vega is carried nearly
through the zenith of Washington and all places in the
same latitude by the apparent daily rotation of the
heavens. It is a star that we have no difficulty in
recognizing, owing to the presence of two nearby stars
that form, with it, a small equal-sided triangle with
sides only two degrees in extent. If our own sun were
at the distance of Vega, it would not appear as bright
as one of these faint stars, so much more brilliant is
this magnificent sun than our own. The two faint stars
that follow so closely after Vega and form the little
triangle with it are also of particular interest. Epsilon
Lyræ, which is the northern one of these two stars,
may be used as a test of keen eyesight. It is the
finest example in the heavens of a quadruple star&mdash;that
is, "a double-double star." A keen eye can just separate
this star into two without a telescope, and with the aid
of a telescope, each of the two splits up into two stars,
making four stars in place of the one visible to the average
eye. Zeta, the other of the two stars that form the
little triangle with Vega, is also a fine double star. The
star that lies almost in a straight line with Epsilon and
Zeta and a short distance to the south of them is a very
interesting variable star known as Beta Lyræ. Its
brightness changes very considerably in a period of
twelve days and twenty-two hours. This change of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
brightness is due to the presence of a companion star.
The two stars are in mutual revolution, and their motion
is viewed at such an angle from the earth that, in
each revolution, one star is eclipsed by the other, producing
a variation in the amount of light that reaches
our eyes. By comparing this star from day to day
with the star just a short distance to the southeast of
it, which does not vary in brightness, we can observe
for ourselves this change in the light of Beta Lyræ.
There are a number of stars in the heavens that vary
in brightness in the same manner as Beta Lyræ, and
they are called eclipsing-variable stars.</p>

<p>On the line connecting Beta Lyræ with the star
southeast of it and one-third of the distance from Beta
to this star, lies the noted Ring Nebula in Lyra, which
is a beautiful object even in a small telescope. It consists
of a ring of luminous gas surrounding a central
star. The star shines with a brilliant, bluish-white
light and is visible only in powerful telescopes though
it is easily photographed since it gives forth rays to
which the photographic plate is particularly sensitive.
In small telescopes the central part of this nebula appears
dark but with a powerful telescope a faint light
may be seen even in the central portion of the nebula.
This is one of the most interesting and beautiful telescopic
objects in the heavens.</p>

<p>It is in the general direction of the constellation of
Lyra that our solar system is speeding at the rate of
more than a million miles a day. This point toward
which we are moving at such tremendous speed lies a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
little to the southwest of Vega, on the border between
the constellations of Lyra and Hercules, and is spoken
of as The Apex of the Sun's Way.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">August&mdash;Sagittarius</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>In the southern sky we have this month the constellation
of Sagittarius, The Archer, which is just to
the east of Scorpio and a considerable distance south of
Lyra. It can be recognized by its peculiar form, which
is that of a short-handled milk dipper, with the bowl
turned toward the south and a trail of bright stars
running from the end of the handle toward the southwest.
This is one of the zodiacal groups which contain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
no first-magnitude stars, but a number of the second
and third magnitude. It is crossed by the Milky Way,
which is very wonderful in its structure at this point.
Some astronomers believe that here&mdash;among the star-clouds
and mists of nebulous light which are intermingled
with dark lanes and holes, in reality dark nebulæ&mdash;lies
the center of the vast system of stars and nebulæ in
which our entire solar system is but the merest speck.
Some of the grandest views through the telescope are
also to be obtained in this beautiful constellation of
Sagittarius, which is so far south that it is seen to
better advantage in the tropics than in the mid-latitudes
of the northern hemispheres.</p>

<h2><a name="X" id="X">X</a><br /><br />

SEPTEMBER</h2>


<p>One of the most beautiful constellations of the
northern hemisphere is Cygnus, The Swan, which
is in the zenith in mid-latitudes about nine o'clock in
the evening the middle of September. It lies directly in
the path of the Milky Way which stretches diagonally
across the heavens from the northeast to the southwest
at this time. In Cygnus, the Milky Way divides into
two branches, one passing through Ophiuchus and
Serpens to Scorpio, and the other through Sagitta and
Aquila to Sagittarius, to meet again in the southern
constellation of Ara, just south of Scorpio and Sagittarius.
On clear, dark evenings, when there is no
moonlight, this long, dark rift in the Milky Way can
be seen very clearly. In Cygnus, as in Ophiuchus,
Scorpio, and Sagittarius we find wonderful star-clouds,
consisting of numberless stars so distant from us and,
therefore, so faint that they do not appear as distinct
points of light except in the greatest telescopes. It is
the combined light from these numberless stars that
cannot be seen separately that produces the impression
of stars massed in clouds of nebulous light and gives
to this girdle of the heavens its name of the Milky
Way. In Cygnus, as in a number of other constellations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of both hemispheres, the Milky Way is crossed
by dark rifts and bars and is very complicated in its
structure. It is in Cygnus, also, that one may see with
the aid of powerful telescopes the vast, irregular, luminous
nebulæ, that are like great clouds of fiery mist.
These nebulæ are of enormous extent, for they cover
space that could be occupied by hundreds of stars.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/image072.jpg" width="500" height="351" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">September&mdash;Cygnus</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Cygnus is a constellation that is filled with the wonders
and mysteries of space and that abounds in beautiful
objects of varied kinds. It is a region one never tires
of exploring with the telescope. The principal stars
in Cygnus form the well-known Northern Cross, with
the beautiful, white, first-magnitude star Deneb, or
Arided, as it is sometimes called, at the top of the
cross, and Albireo, the orange-and-blue double star
at the foot. Albireo, among all the pairs of contrasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
hues, has the distinction of being considered the
finest double star in the heavens for small telescopes.
This star marks the head of The Swan, as well as the
foot of the Northern Cross, and Deneb marks the tail
of The Swan. A short distance to the southeast of
Deneb, on the right wing of The Swan, is a famous
little star, 61 Cygni, barely visible to the naked eye and
forming a little triangle with two brighter stars to the
east. This star has the distinction of being the first
one to have its distance from the solar system determined.
The famous mathematician and astronomer
Bessel accomplished this difficult feat in the year 1838.
Since that day, the distances of many stars have been
found by various methods, but of all these stars only
four or five are known to be nearer to us than 61
Cygni. Its distance is about eight light-years, so its
light takes about eight years to travel the distance that
separates it from the solar system. As a result, we
see it not as it is tonight, but as it was at the time
when the light now entering our eyes first started on
its journey eight years ago. 61 Cygni is also a double
star, and the combined light of the two stars gives
forth only one-tenth as much light as our own sun.
Most of the brilliant first-magnitude stars give forth
many times as much light as the sun; but among the
fainter stars, we find some that appear faint because
they are very distant, and some that are faint because
they are dwarf stars and have little light to give forth.
To the class of nearby, feebly-shining dwarf stars 61
Cygni belongs. Deneb, on the other hand, is one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the giant stars, and is at an immeasurably great distance
from the solar system.</p>

<p>Just south of Cygnus in the eastern branch of the
Milky Way lie Sagitta, The Arrow, and Aquila, The
Eagle. Not far to the northeast of Aquila is the odd
little constellation of Delphinus, The Dolphin, popularly
referred to as Job's Coffin. There will be no difficulty
in finding this small star-group, owing to its peculiar
diamond-shaped configuration. Its five principal stars
are of the fourth magnitude. It is in the constellation
of Delphinus that the most distant known object in the
heavens is located. This is the globular star cluster known
only by its catalogue number of N.G.C. 7006. It is
estimated to be at a distance of 220,000 light-years from
the earth.</p>

<p>Sagitta, The Arrow, lies midway between Albireo
and the brilliant Altair in Aquila. The point of the
arrow is indicated by the star that is farthest east; and
the feather, by the two faint stars to the west. Like
Delphinus, this constellation is very small and contains
no objects of particular interest.</p>

<p>Altair (Flying Eagle) is the brilliant white star of
the first magnitude in Aquila and is attended by two
fainter stars, one on either side, at nearly equal distances
from it. These two stars serve readily to
distinguish this star, all three stars being nearly in
a straight line. Altair is one of the nearer stars, its
distance from the earth being about sixteen light-years.
It gives forth about ten times as much light as the
sun.</p>

<p>We cannot leave the constellation of Aquila without
referring to the wonderful temporary star or nova,
known as Nova Aquilæ No. 3 (because it was the third
nova to appear in this constellation), which appeared
in the position indicated on the chart upon the eighth
of June, 1918. A few days previous to this date, there
was in this position an extremely faint star, invisible
to the naked eye and in small telescopes. This fact
became known from later examinations of old photographs
of this region that had been taken at the
Harvard College Observatory, where the photographing
of the heavens is carried on regularly for the purpose
of having a record of celestial changes and happenings.
Clouds prevented the obtaining of any photographs of
this part of the heavens on the four nights preceding the
eighth of June, but on this evening there shone in the
place of the faint telescopic star, a wonderful temporary
star, or nova, which was destined on the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
evening to outshine all stars in the heavens, with the
exception of the brightest of all, Sirius, which it
closely rivaled in brilliancy at the height of its outburst.
Within less than a week's time, this faint star in the
Milky Way for some mysterious reason increased in
brightness many thousandfold. Such outbursts have
been recorded before, but on rare occasions, however.
No star since the appearance of the nova known as
Kepler's Star, in the year 1604, which at its greatest
brilliancy rivaled Jupiter, shone with such splendor or
attracted so much attention as Nova Aquilæ. In the
year 1901, there appeared in the constellation of
Perseus a star known as Nova Persei which at its
brightest surpassed Vega, but its splendor was not as
great as that of the wonderful nova of 1918.</p>

<p>It speaks well for the zeal and interest of amateur
astronomers, as well as for their acquaintance with the
stars, that Nova Persei was discovered by an amateur
astronomer, Dr. Anderson, and that among the deluge
of telephone calls and telegrams received at the Harvard
College Observatory on the night of June 8th, announcing
independent discoveries of the "new star," were
many from non-professional astronomers.</p>

<p>Like all stars of this class, Nova Aquilæ No. 3
sank rapidly into oblivion. In a few weeks it was only
a third-magnitude star; a few weeks more and it was
invisible without a telescope. Many wonderful and
interesting changes have been recorded in the appearance
of this star, however, even after it became visible
only in the telescope. Soon after its outburst it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
appeared to develop a nebulous envelope, as have other
novas before it. It showed in addition many of the
peculiarities of the nebulæ, though the central star
remained visible as before the outburst.</p>

<p>Astronomers are still in doubt as to the cause of
these outbursts, which certainly indicate celestial catastrophies
of some form on a gigantic scale. All novas
possess one characteristic in common&mdash;that of appearing
exclusively in the Milky Way; and another characteristic
is the development of a nebular envelope after the
outburst of greatest brightness. In some cases temporary
stars have been known to be variable in brightness
for years before the great outburst. Such a star
was Nova Aquila, for the examination of photographs
of this region taken some years previous showed variations
in its brightness for a period of thirty years at
least.</p>

<p>Up to the beginning of this century only about
thirty novas had been discovered. Since that date,
thanks to the vigilance of the astronomers of today
and to the aid of photography, more have been discovered
than in all the preceding centuries. These
outbursts of new stars appear to be not so rare as the
earlier astronomers believed, though great outbursts as
brilliant as that of Nova Aquila are very uncommon.</p>

OCTOBER</h2>


<p>The constellations that will be found nearest the
meridian in early October evenings are the circumpolar
constellations Cepheus and Cassiopeia, and in the
southern sky, Capricornus and Aquarius.</p>

<p>Cepheus, The King, and Cassiopeia, his Queen, of
whom we shall have more to say later in connection
with the constellations of Andromeda and Perseus, sit
facing the north pole of the heavens opposite Ursa
Major, The Great Bear, familiar to us under the name
of The Big Dipper. The foot of Cepheus rests upon
the tail of the Little Bear, and the star farthest north
in the diagram is in the left knee. The head is marked
by a small triangle of faint stars, shown in the diagram.
One of these three faint stars&mdash;the one farthest
east&mdash;known as Delta Cephei, is a very remarkable
variable star, changing periodically in brightness every
five and one-third days. Its name has been given to a
large class of variable stars&mdash;the Cepheid variables&mdash;that
resemble Delta Cephei in being giant suns, faint
only because they are at very great distances from the
earth, and varying in brightness with the greatest
regularity in periods that range from a few hours to
several weeks. It has been found that the longer the
period of light change the greater is the star in size<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and brightness. The Cepheids of longest period are
10,000 times more brilliant than our own sun. Cepheus
contains no very bright or conspicuous stars. Alpha
Cephei, the brightest star in the group, marks The
King's right shoulder. It is the star farthest to the
west in the diagram, and is only a third-magnitude star.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image079.jpg" width="400" height="349" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">October&mdash;Cassiopeia and Cepheus</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Cassiopeia is a constellation with which every one
in the northern hemisphere should be familiar, owing
to its very distinctive W-shape and its far northern
position, which brings it conspicuously into view
throughout the clear fall and winter evenings. Cassiopeia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
is pictured in all star atlases that show the mythological
figures, with her face toward the north pole.
The stars in the W outline the body. Alpha, the star
farthest south in the diagram marks the breast of Cassiopeia.
Her head and uplifted hands are represented
by faint stars south of Alpha. This star is occasionally
referred to by its Arabic name of Schedir. Beta,
the leader of all the stars in the W in their
daily westward motion, is also known by an Arabic
name, Caph.</p>

<p>In the constellation of Cassiopeia there appeared in
the year 1572 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, a wonderful temporary star which
suddenly, within a few days' time, became as brilliant
as the planet Venus and was clearly visible in broad
daylight. This star is often referred to as Tycho's
Star, because it was observed, and its position very
accurately determined, by Tycho Brahe, one of the most
famous of the old astronomers. This star remained
visible to every one for about sixteen months, but
it finally faded completely from view, and it is believed
that a faint, nebulous red star, visible only in the
telescope and close to the position recorded by Tycho,
represents the smoldering embers of the star that once
struck terror to the hearts of the superstitious and
ignorant among all the nations of Europe, who took
it to be a sign that the end of the world was at hand.</p>

<p>Both Cassiopeia and Cepheus lie in the path of the
Milky Way, which reaches its farthest northern point
in Cassiopeia and passes from Cepheus in a southerly
direction into the constellation of Cygnus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image081.jpg" width="400" height="365" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">October&mdash;Aquarius and Capricornus</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Turning now to southern skies, we find on and to the
west of the meridian at this time the rather inconspicuous
zodiacal constellation of Capricornus, The Goat. It
contains no stars of great brightness and is chiefly remarkable
for the fact that it contains one of the few
double stars that can be seen without the aid of a
telescope. The least distance in the heavens that the
unaided human eye can separate is about four minutes
of arc. The star Alpha in Capricornus is made up
of two stars separated by a distance of six minutes
of arc, so that any one can readily see that it consists of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
two stars very close together. This star, Alpha, will
be found in the extreme western part of the constellation,
and can best be located in conjunction with the
star Beta, which is slightly brighter and lies but a short
distance almost due south of Alpha, the two stars
standing somewhat alone in this part of the heavens.</p>

<p>To the north and east of Capricornus we find Aquarius,
which is also a zodiacal constellation. Aquarius
is the Water-Bearer, and the water jar which he
carries is represented by a small, but distinct, Y of
stars from which flows a stream of faint stars toward
the southeast and south. Aquarius, like Capricornus,
is a rather uninteresting constellation, as it is made up
of inconspicuous third- and fourth-magnitude stars.
The entire region covered by these two groups of stars
is remarkably barren, since it contains not a single
first- or even second-magnitude star and little to attract
the observer's eye.</p>

<p>To relieve the barrenness of this region, there appears
just to the south of Aquarius and southeast of
Capricornus, sparkling low in the southern sky on
crisp October evenings, the beautiful first-magnitude
star Fomalhaut in the small southern constellation of
Piscis Australis, The Southern Fish. This star is
the farthest south of all the brilliant first-magnitude
stars that can be seen from the middle latitudes of the
Northern Hemisphere. The constellation in which it
lies is so close to the southern horizon in our latitudes
that it cannot be seen to any advantage, and it is at
best very inconspicuous, containing no other objects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of interest. Fomalhaut cannot be mistaken for any
other star visible at this time of year in the evening,
since it stands in such a solitary position far to the
south. At the time of which we are writing it will be
found a few degrees east of the meridian.</p>

NOVEMBER</h2>


<p>Directly south of Cassiopeia and Cepheus, the
circumpolar constellations with which we became
acquainted last month, and almost overhead in our latitudes
in the early evening hours of November, lie
Pegasus, The Winged Horse, and Andromeda, The
Woman Chained.</p>

<p>According to the legend, Cepheus was king of
Ethiopia, and Cassiopeia was the beautiful, but vain,
queen who dared to compare herself in beauty with
the sea-nymphs. This so enraged the nymphs that,
as a punishment for her presumption, they decided
to send a terrible sea-monster to ravage the coast of the
kingdom. The king and queen, upon consulting the
oracle, found that the only way to avert this calamity
would be to chain their daughter Andromeda to the
rocks and permit the monster to devour her.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image085.jpg" width="400" height="342" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">November&mdash;Andromeda and Pegasus</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>As the story goes, the valiant hero, Perseus, chanced
to be riding through the air on his winged horse and
saw, far beneath him the beautiful maiden chained to
the rocks and the frightful monster approaching to
devour her. He immediately went to the rescue, and,
after a terrible struggle with the monster, succeeded in
overpowering him and thus saved the maiden from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
dreadful fate. Perseus and the fair Andromeda were
married shortly afterward, and at the end of a happy
life the pair were transferred to the heavens. Cassiopeia,
the vain queen, was ordered to be bound to a
chair and, with the king Cepheus at her side, to be
swung continually around the north pole of the heavens
that she might be taught a lesson in humility.</p>

<p>The constellation Cetus, representing the sea-monster,
will be found to the southeast and south of Pisces,
The Fishes, which lie south of Andromeda and Pegasus.</p>

<p>The Great Square in Pegasus is the most conspicuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
configuration of stars to be seen in the heavens in
autumn evenings. The star that marks the northeastern
corner of The Great Square belongs to the
constellation of Andromeda and marks the head of the
maiden, who is resting upon the shoulders of Pegasus,
The Winged Horse. The three bright stars nearly in
a straight line outline the maiden's body, Alpha, or
Alpheratz, as it is called, being the star in the head,
Beta or Mirach in the waist, and Gamma or Almach
in the left foot. The last-named star, which is farthest
to the northeast in the diagram, was, in the opinion
of the noted astronomer Herschel, the finest double star
in the heavens. The two stars into which the telescope
splits it are of the beautifully contrasted shades of
orange and sea green.</p>

<p>A second most interesting object in Andromeda
and one of the finest in the entire heavens is The Great
Andromeda Nebula, which is faintly visible without
the aid of a telescope as a hazy patch of light. It is
believed that in reality this nebula is a great universe
composed of many thousands of stars so distant that
no telescope can show the individual members and that
the light from it takes many thousands of years to
span the abyss that separates it from the solar system.
Some magnificent photographs of The Great Andromeda
Nebula have been taken with powerful telescopes.
It is through the use of photography that
the nebulæ can best be studied, for a photographic
plate after long exposure, reveals a wonderful detail
in the structure of these objects that the human eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
fails to see. On a clear, dark evening one may find
The Great Andromeda Nebula by the aid of two faint
stars with which it makes a small triangle, as shown
in the chart. This nebula is the only one of the spiral
nebula that can be seen in these latitudes without the
aid of a telescope, though there are several spiral
nebulæ in the southern heavens that can be thus seen.</p>

<p>Lying to the northwest of The Great Square in
Pegasus are a number of faint stars that outline the
shoulders and head of the winged steed, while the
stars to the southwest of the square outline his forelegs.
The creature is represented without hind quarters
in all star atlases. The space within The Great
Square contains no bright stars, and as a result, the
outline of the square stands out with great distinctness.
There are, in fact, no stars of the first magnitude in
either Pegasus or Andromeda, though there are a
number of the second and third magnitude which very
clearly show the distinctive forms of these two star-groups.</p>

<p>Pisces, The Fishes, the constellation just south of
Andromeda and Pegasus, is the first of the twelve
zodiacal constellations. It consists of the southern
fish, lying in an east-to-west direction, and the northern
fish, lying nearly north and south, the two touching at
the southeastern extremity of the constellation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image088.jpg" width="400" height="363" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">November&mdash;Pisces</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>There is in Pisces not a single bright star, and its
only point of interest is to be found in the fact that
it contains the point, marked by the cross and letter V
in the diagram, that is known variously as "the vernal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
equinox," "the equinoctial point" and "The First Point
in Aries." This is a very important point of reference
in the heavens, just as the meridian of Greenwich is
for the earth, and it marks the point where the sun
crosses the equator going north in the spring. Owing
to the Precession of the Equinoxes, as it is called,
this point is gradually shifting its position westward
through the zodiacal constellations at a rate that will
carry it completely around the heavens through the
twelve zodiacal groups in a period of 25,800 years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Since the beginning of the Christian era, this point has
backed from the constellation of Aries, which lies
just east of Pisces, into Pisces, though it still retains
its name of "The First Point in Aries."</p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII">XIII</a><br /><br />

DECEMBER</h2>


<p>The eastern half of the sky on early December
evenings is adorned with some of the finest star-groups
in the heavens; but as we are considering for
each month only the constellations that lie on or near
the meridian in the early evening hours, we must turn
our eyes for the present from the sparkling brilliants in
the east to the stars in the less conspicuous groups of
Aries, The Ram, and Cetus, The Whale. We will
also become acquainted this month with the beautiful
and interesting constellation of Perseus, the hero of
mythical fame to whom we referred last month in connection
with the legend of Cepheus and Cassiopeia.
Cetus, you will recall, represents the sea-monster sent
to devour Andromeda, the daughter of Cepheus and
Cassiopeia. We have included the constellation of
Andromeda in our diagram for this month, since it
is so closely associated in legend with the constellations
of Perseus and Cetus, though we also showed it last
month.</p>

<p>The brightest star in Perseus, known as Alpha
Persei, is at the center of a curved line of stars that
is concave or hollow toward the northeast. This line
of stars is called the Segment of Perseus, and it lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
along the path of the Milky Way, which passes from
this point in a northwesterly direction into Cassiopeia.
According to the legend, Perseus, in his great haste
to rescue the maiden from Cetus, the monster, stirred
up a great dust, which is represented by the numberless
faint stars in the Milky Way at this point. The star
Alpha is in the midst of one of the finest regions of
the heavens for the possessor of a good field-glass
or small telescope.</p>

<p>A short distance to the southwest of Alpha is one of
the most interesting objects in the heavens. To the
ancients, it represented the baleful, winking demon-eye
in the head of the snaky-locked Gorgon, Medusa, whom
Perseus vanquished in one of his earliest exploits and
whose head he carried in his hand at the time of the
rescue of Andromeda. To the astronomers, however,
Algol is known as Beta Persei, a star that has been
found to consist of two stars revolving about each
other and separated by a distance not much greater than
their own diameters. One of the stars is so faint that
we speak of it as a dark star, though it does emit a
faint light. Once in every revolution the faint star
passes directly between us and the bright star and
partly eclipses it, shutting off five-sixths of its light.
This happens with great regularity once in a little less
than three days. It is for this reason that Algol
varies in brightness in this period. There are a number
of stars that vary in brightness in a similar manner.
Their periods of light-change are all very short, and
the astronomers call them eclipsing variables. At its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
brightest, Algol is slightly brighter than the star nearest
to it in Andromeda, which is an excellent star with
which to compare it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image092.jpg" width="400" height="396" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">December&mdash;Perseus, Aries and Cetus</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Perseus is another one of the constellations lying
in the Milky Way in which temporary stars or novas
have suddenly flashed forth. At the point indicated by
a cross in the diagram, Dr. Anderson, an amateur
astronomer of Scotland, found on February 21, 1901,
a new star as brilliant as the pole-star. On the following
day it became brighter than a star of the first
magnitude. A day later it had lost a third of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
light, and in a few weeks it was invisible without the
aid of a telescope. In a year it was invisible in all
except the most powerful telescopes. With such telescopes,
it may still be seen as a very faint nebulous
light.</p>

<p>Triangulum and Aries are two rather inconspicuous
constellations that lie on, or close to, the meridian at
this time. There is nothing remarkable about either
of these groups, except that Aries is one of the
twelve zodiacal constellations. Some centuries ago,
the sun was to be found in Aries at the beginning of
spring and the position it occupies in the sky at that
time was called the First Point in Aries. As this
point is slowly shifting westward, as we have explained
elsewhere, the sun is now to be found in Pisces, instead
of Aries at the beginning of spring and does not enter
Aries until a month later. Pisces was one of the constellations
for November and we showed in that constellation
the present position of the sun at the beginning
of spring.</p>

<p>Two stars in Aries&mdash;Alpha and Beta&mdash;are fairly
bright, Alpha being fully as bright as the brightest
star in Andromeda. Beta lies a short distance to the
southwest of Alpha, and a little to the southwest of
Beta is Gamma, the three stars forming a short curved
line of stars that distinguishes this constellation from
other groups. The remaining stars in Aries are
all faint.</p>

<p>Just south of Aries lies the head of Cetus, The
Whale. This is an enormous constellation that extends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
far to the southwest, below a part of Pisces,
which runs in between Andromeda and Cetus. Its
brightest star, Beta, Diphda, or Deneb Kaitos, as it
is severally called, stands quite alone not far above the
southwestern horizon. It is almost due south of Alpha
Andromedæ, the star in Andromeda farthest to the
west, which it exactly equals in brightness. The head
of Cetus is marked by a five-sided figure composed of
stars that are all faint with the single exception of
Alpha, which is fairly bright, though inferior to Beta
or Diphda.</p>

<p>Cetus, though made up chiefly of faint stars, and
on the whole uninteresting, contains one of the most
peculiar objects in the heavens, the star known as
Omicron Ceti or Mira (The Wonderful). This star
suddenly rises from invisibility nearly to the brightness
of a first-magnitude star for a short period once
every eleven months. Mira was the first known variable
star. Its remarkable periodic change in brightness
was discovered by Fabricius in the year 1596,
so its peculiar behavior has been under observation for
three hundred and twenty-five years. It is called a
long-period variable star, because its variations of light
take place in a period of months instead of a few hours
or days, as is the case with stars such as Algol. Mira
is not only a wonderful star, it is a mysterious star as
well, for the cause of its light-changes are not known,
as in the case of Algol where the loss of light is
produced by a dark star passing in front of a
brighter star. Mira is a deep-red star, as are all long-period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
variable stars that change irregularly in brightness.
It is visible without a telescope for only one
month or six weeks out of the eleven months. During
the remainder of this time, it sometimes loses so much
of its light that it cannot be found with telescopes of
considerable size. Its periods of light-change are
quite variable as is also the amount of light it gains
at different appearances.</p>

<p>It is believed that the cause of the light-changes of
Mira is to be found within the star itself. It has been
thought that dense clouds of vapors may surround
these comparatively cool, red stars and that the imprisoned
heat finally bursts through these vapors and
we see for a short time the glowing gases below; then
the vapors once more collect for a long period, to be
followed by another sudden outburst of heat and light.</p>

<p>It is interesting to remember in this connection that
our own sun has been found to be slightly variable
in the amount of light and heat that it gives forth at
different times, and the cause of its changes in light
and heat are believed to lie within the sun itself.</p>

STARS OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE</h2>


<p>As one travels southward from the mid-latitudes of
the northern hemisphere into the tropics our familiar
circumpolar constellations sink lower and lower in the
northern heavens and strange and unfamiliar star-groups
rise gradually above the southern horizon. If
we make our southward journey in the winter months
the first of the southern constellations to come fully
into view is the small star-group just south of Lepus
known as Columba (The Dove), whose brightest
star Phact is of the second magnitude. A line drawn
from Procyon to Sirius and extended as far again
brings us to this star and a line from Betelgeuze to
Sirius extended an equal distance brings us to Zeta
Argus which is equal to Phact in brightness. The two
lines intersecting at Sirius make the "Egyptian X"
as it is called.</p>

<p>Magnificent, blue-white Canopus, the most brilliant
star in the heavens next to Sirius, a veritable diamond
sparkling low in the southern sky, now commands our
unqualified admiration. Canopus lies about 35° south
of Sirius and is invisible north of the 37th parallel
of latitude. At nine o'clock in the evening of February
6th it can be seen just above the southern horizon in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
that latitude and is then a conspicuous object in Georgia,
Florida and the Gulf States.</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The star of Egypt whose proud light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never hath beamed on those who rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the White Islands of the West."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>writes Moore of Canopus in "Lalla Rookh."</p>

<p>Along the Nile Canopus was an object of worship
as the god of waters. At the time of their erection,
6400 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, a number of temples in Upper Egypt were
oriented so as to show Canopus at sunrise at the
autumnal equinox, and other temples erected many
centuries later were oriented in a similar manner. In
China, as late as 100 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and in India also Canopus
was an object of worship.</p>

<p>The astronomer tells us that Canopus is immeasurably
distant from the earth. It has been estimated to be
forty thousand times more luminous than our sun.</p>

<p>Canopus is located in the constellation of Argo
Navis which is the largest and most conspicuous constellation
in the heavens. In addition to Canopus it
contains a number of second- and third-magnitude
stars and is subdivided for convenience into Puppis,
The Prow; Carina, The Keel; and Vela, The Sails.
Huge as it is, Argo Navis represents only half of a
ship for the stern is lacking. According to the legend
this ship was built by Argos, aided by Pallas Athene,
for Jason, the leader of the expedition of the fifty
Argonauts who sailed from Greece to Colchis in search
of the golden fleece. Pallas Athene placed in the bow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of the ship a piece of timber from the speaking oak
of Dodona to guide the crew and warn them of dangers
and after the voyage the ship was supposed to have
been placed in the heavens.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image098.jpg" width="400" height="396" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Southern Constellations&mdash;1. In February</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>In Argo Navis is one of the finest telescopic objects
in the heavens, the Keyhole Nebula, as it is usually
called, from a peculiar-shaped dark patch in its brightest
part. On the border of this nebula is the deep-red
Wonder Star of the southern hemisphere, Eta Argus,
which varies suddenly and unexpectedly in brightness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
between the seventh and first magnitudes. In 1843 it
burst forth with a splendor rivaling Sirius and maintained
this brilliancy for nearly ten years and then
slowly waned in brilliancy until it disappeared to the
unaided eye in 1886. The surrounding nebula also
seems to share in its peculiar fluctuations of brightness.
Eta Argus is now a star of the seventh magnitude
and since it is still varying fitfully in brightness
it is believed that the history of its light-changes is
not complete.</p>

<p>Among the constellations of the southern heavens
near the meridian in February we see in addition to
Argo Navis the constellations of Dorado, The Goldfish;
Hydrus, The Serpent, and Tucana, The Toucan.
Though insignificant in appearance Dorado contains
what was described by Sir John Herschel as one of
the most extraordinary objects in the heavens, a
worthy rival of The Great Orion Nebula and in some
respects very similar to it, The Great Looped Nebula,
"the center of a great spiral." In Dorado also is located
The Greater Magellanic Cloud which looks like
a detached portion of the Milky Way though it is
far removed from it. To the naked eye it resembles a
small white cloud about 4° in extent. In the telescope
it bears a close resemblance to a typical portion of
the Milky Way. A similar formation known as The
Lesser Magellanic Cloud is located in Hydrus. It has
been estimated that the distance of The Lesser Cloud
is 80,000 light-years and that it is receding from us.</p>

<p>In Tucana is located one of the finest globular star<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
clusters in the heavens, known as 47 Tucanæ. This
cluster and Omega Centauri, a globular star cluster in
Centaurus, are the two nearest of all the globular clusters.
They are distant from the earth about 22,000
light-years and it is known that the combined light of
the thousands of stars of which each cluster is composed
is about one million times that of our own sun.</p>

<p>In the western sky in the southern hemisphere in
February may be seen the brilliant, white, first-magnitude
star Achernar in the river Eridanus, the long,
winding constellation that, we recall, starts near the
brilliant Rigel in Orion and disappears from the view
of northern observers below the southern horizon,
extending its course far into the southern hemisphere.
Achernar means "The End of the River" and this is
nearly its position in the constellation.</p>

<p>Though Argo Navis is the largest and most important
constellation of the southern hemisphere, Crux,
The Southern Cross, far-famed in story and legend
as well as for its historical associations, is beyond a
doubt the most popular.</p>

<p>The best time to view the Southern Cross is in
June or July when it is near the meridian. It is not
seen to advantage in the months of January or February.
It then lies on its side and close to the horizon
and therefore is dimmed by atmospheric haze so that
it almost invariably is a disappointing object to the
tourist from the north who usually views it for the
first time in one of these months. The Cross is
viewed to advantage in the latitude of Rio or Valparaiso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and it is best seen from the Straits where it
rides high overhead. It is not seen to advantage from
the latitudes of Cuba or Jamaica. It is small, only
6° in extent from north to south and less in width
and it lies in the most brilliant portion of the Milky
Way which is here a narrow stream only three or
four degrees wide. Directly below the Cross is the
noted Coal Sack, apparently a yawning chasm in the
midst of its brilliant surroundings though probably in
reality a dark nebula. Viewed with the telescopes a
number of stars are to be seen projected on this dark
background.</p>

<p>The Southern Cross is to the inhabitants of the
southern hemisphere what the Big Dipper is to those
who dwell in the northern hemisphere&mdash;an infallible
timepiece. The upright of the Cross points toward
the south pole of the heavens which lies in a region
where there is a singular dearth of bright stars, the
nearest star to the south pole being a faint fifth-magnitude
star called Sigma Octantis. When seen in the
southeast or southwest the Cross lies on its side, but
when passing the meridian it stands nearly upright.
Humboldt, referring to this fact, says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"How often have we heard our guides exclaim in
the savannahs of Venezuela and in the desert extending
from Lima to Truxillo, 'Midnight is past, the Cross
begins to bend.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>By the explorers of the sixteenth century the Cross
was taken as a sign of heaven's approval of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
attempt to establish the Christian religion in the wilds
of the New World. This thought is beautifully expressed
in Mrs. Hemans' lines in "The Cross of the
South."</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But to thee, as thy lode-stars resplendently burn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their clear depths of blue, with devotion I turn<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Alpha Crucis, the brightest star in Crux, is at the
foot of the Cross. It consists in reality of two second-magnitude
stars forming a beautiful double while a
third fifth-magnitude star one and one-half minutes of
arc distant makes with this pair a combination similar
to our Mizar and Alcor of the Big Dipper though
the separation is not great enough to be visible to the
naked eye. The second-magnitude star at the head
of the Cross is a deep orange in color and the two
stars that mark the ends of the cross-arm are white
third-magnitude stars.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Southern Constellations&mdash;2. In July</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>One of the finest constellations of the southern
hemisphere is Centaurus, The Centaur, which surrounds
Crux on the north and is more than 60° in
length. Its center lies about 50° south of Spica in
Virgo and below the tail of Hydra. Alpha Centauri,
its brightest star and the nearest star to the solar system,
four and one-third light-years away, is a golden-yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
double star that forms with the star Beta Centauri
on the west a configuration similar to that of
Castor and Pollux in Gemini, only one that is far more
striking because of the superior brilliancy of the stars.
Alpha Centauri lies in the Milky Way and transits the
meridian at the same time with Arcturus though it
cannot be seen north of the 29th parallel. Alpha
Centauri, like Canopus, was an object of worship in
Egypt and a number of temples in northern Egypt
were oriented to its emergence from the sun's rays in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the morning at the autumnal equinox, between 3000
and 2575 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>North of Centaurus is the constellation Lupus, The
Wolf, which is also crossed by the Milky Way. According
to one myth Lupus is held in the right hand
of the Centaur as an offering upon the altar which
is represented by the constellation of Ara next to
Centaurus on the east. Ara also is crossed by the
Milky Way. Neither Lupus nor Ara contain any
objects that are worthy of special attention.</p>

<p>Triangulum Australe, The Southern Triangle, a
little to the southeast of Alpha Centauri, is far more
conspicuous than the Triangulum of the northern
hemisphere.</p>

<p>The accompanying charts give two views of these
principal southern constellations that lie within 40°
of the south pole of the heavens and that are below
the horizon in 40° north latitude. The first of these
charts shows the constellations that are nearest the
meridian in the early evening hours in February.
Canopus in Argo Navis and the Greater Magellanic
Cloud then lie close to the meridian. Argo Navis
with its subdivisions Puppis, Vela and Carina are
found east of the meridian lying directly in the path
of the Milky Way, which stretches diagonally across
the sky from the northwest to the southeast. Far
over in the southeast appears Crux, the Southern
Cross, also directly in the path of the Milky Way.
In the western heavens may be seen the Lesser Magellanic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Cloud in Hydrus, brilliant Achernar in Eridanus
and the inconspicuous star-group of Tucana.</p>

<p>In the early evening hours of July we find as shown
on the second chart, Alpha and Beta Centauri in
Centaurus close to the meridian, Lupus due north of
Centaurus, Ara and Triangulum Australe in the southeast
and Crux in fine position for observation just
west of the meridian. Carina of Argo Navis lies
to the southwest of Crux. The Milky Way now
arches magnificently across the heavens from Carina
through Crux, Centaurus and Lupus and Ara to the
zodiacal groups of Scorpio and Sagittarius in the
northeast.</p>

<p>In the northern part of the heavens, as seen from
the southern hemisphere, appear the familiar zodiacal
constellations that we of the northern hemisphere find
south of the zenith, as well as the constellations of
Orion, Lepus and Canis Major, Hydra, Corvus and
Crater, Ophiuchus and Serpens and Aquila, all finely
in view in their appropriate seasons.</p>

<p>It is only our familiar circumpolar constellations
of the north&mdash;The Two Bears, Draco, Cassiopeia, and
Cepheus, Andromeda and Perseus and Auriga that
are invisible in mid-latitudes of the southern hemisphere
just as the constellations shown in the diagrams,
and a few additional groups such as Pavo,
Grus, Phoenix, Apus, Mensa and Volans which we
have not shown, lie hidden from view beneath the
southern horizon in mid-latitudes of the northern
hemisphere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>The northern visitor to the southern hemisphere
familiar with the constellations of his own land is
filled with a queer sensation of being in topsy-turvydom
as he sees familiar Orion standing on his head and
all of the zodiacal constellations passing in their daily
motions to the north instead of to the south of his
zenith while by day the sun passes across the northern
part of the heavens and culminates north instead of
south of his zenith. He misses the familiar Dippers
of his own land and searches in vain for a pole-star
in the unfamiliar circumpolar regions of the south.</p>

THE MILKY WAY OR GALAXY</h2>

<p>On clear, winter evenings one may see a portion
of the zone of the Milky Way, which encircles
the heavens, arching magnificently across the heavens
as it passes from Cassiopeia and Cepheus in the northwest,
through Perseus and Auriga and the eastern
part of Taurus, across the feet of Gemini, between
Canis Minor and Orion and through the eastern part
of Canis Major to the southern horizon.</p>

<p>At this point it passes beyond our range of vision
into the star-groups of Puppis, Vela and Carina, subdivisions
of the huge southern constellation of Argo
Navis. It reaches its greatest distance south of the
celestial equator and also attains its greatest brilliancy
in Crux, the far-famed Southern Cross. From here
it turns northward once more, passing into Centaurus,
Musca, Circinus Ara and Lupus constellations of the
southern hemisphere and comes within our range of
vision again in Sagittarius and Scorpio. Here the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Milky Way divides into two branches, though some
astronomers now believe that this apparent division
into two branches is due to the presence of an
enormous cloud of non-luminous matter lying along
the course of the Milky Way at this point, similar
in its nature to the dark "holes" and "caves" and
streaks that appear in all portions of the Milky Way
and most noticeably athwart its course in Argo and
Centaurus.</p>

<p>One of these branches of the Milky Way passes
from Sagittarius through Aquila to Cygnus and the
other through Scorpio, Ophiuchus and Serpens to Cygnus,
the two extending diagonally across the heavens
in the late summer and early fall evenings from the
northeast to the southwest. From Cygnus, the Milky
Way passes into Cepheus and Cassiopeia and thus
completes its circuit of the heavens.</p>

<p>It is not seen to advantage in spring or early summer
evenings because it then rests nearly on the horizon.
Its plane is inclined about 63° to the celestial
equator and its poles lie in the constellations of Coma
Berenicis and Cetus. These are the two points that
lie farthest from the Milky Way.</p>

<p>The Milky Way has been called the groundwork
of the universe. By far the greater number of all the
stars are crowded towards its plane in the form of
an enormous flattened disk or lens.</p>

<p>Our solar system, it has been estimated, lies close
to the plane of the Milky Way and at a distance of
some 50,000 or 60,000 light-years from its center.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
The diameter of the Milky Way as deduced from Dr.
Harlow Shapley's work on globular star clusters
is about 300,000 light-years in extent, or ten times
greater than the limit set some years ago.</p>

<p>The apparent crowding together of the stars into
dense clouds in the Milky Way is partly an effect
due to our position in the Milky Way. When we look
at the heavens in a direction at right angles to this
plane we find comparatively few stars lying along
our line of vision because the stars are actually
fewer in number in this direction. If we look <em>along</em>
the plane of the Milky Way, however, we see to a
greater distance through an enormous depth of stars.
Though individual stars may not be much closer together
in the Milky Way than they are outside of
it, there are on the whole more of them and the effect
of greater density is produced.</p>

<p>Father Hagen of the Vatican Observatory, who has
for years made a study of the dark clouds of obscuring
matter and dark nebulæ that abound in space,
has found evidence of the existence of many vast clouds
of dark obscuring matter over the entire heavens
above and below the plane of the Milky Way as well
as surrounding the Milky Way in its own plane. The
existence of such clouds of non-luminous matter would
account partly for the comparative fewness of stars
in space outside of the plane of the Milky Way since
many stars would be concealed from our eyes by these
obscuring clouds. There is, however, in addition, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
actual crowding of all the visible stars toward this
plane.</p>

<p>The peoples of all ages have honored the Milky
Way in story and legend. It has been universally
referred to as The Sky River and The Pathway of
Souls. To the little Hiawatha, we remember, the
"wrinkled old Nakomis"</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">To the Kingdom of Ponemah<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>In <cite>The Galaxy</cite>, Longfellow thus describes the
Milky Way:</p>

<span class="i0">Along whose bed the glimmering stars are seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like gold and silver sands in some ravine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where mountain streams have left their channels bare!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Sweden, where the Milky Way arches high
through the zenith in winter, it is called the Winter
Street, and Miss Edith Thomas writes thus beautifully
of it in her poem entitled, "The Winter Street":</p>

<div class="cpoem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">As the dust of that Street their footfalls kiss<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Does it not brighter and brighter grow?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

of them picture even remotely the awe-inspiring
grandeur of the Milky Way as it actually exists.</p>

</div>

<p>Millions upon millions of far distant suns equal to or
surpassing our own sun in brilliancy are gathered
within this vast encircling zone of the heavens, their
combined light giving to the naked eye the impression
of a milky band of light. Nine-tenths of all the stars,
it has been estimated, lie close to the plane of the
Galaxy, as well as all the vast expanses of luminous
gaseous nebulæ and clouds of dark obscuring matter
all seemingly intermingled in chaotic confusion; yet
law and order govern the motions of all. Here also
are the great moving star clusters such as the Pleiades
and the Hyades and all of the brilliant "Orion" stars.</p>

<p>The structure of the Milky Way is not clearly understood
but many astronomers believe there is evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
that it takes the form of a vast spiral nebula along
whose arms the stars pass to and fro.</p>

<p>Beyond the Milky Way at enormous distances of
many thousands of light-years, but apparently influenced
by it, lie the globular star-clusters and the
spiral nebulæ. The spirals appear to avoid the plane
of the Milky Way for they are receding in the direction
of its poles at high velocities; the globular clusters
on the other hand are drawing in toward the
Milky Way on either side, and in time will cross it.</p>

<p>Whether these objects external to the Milky Way
form with it one enormous universe or whether the
spiral nebulæ are in turn galaxies or "island universes,"
as the astronomer calls them, similar in form and
structure to our own galaxy and at inconceivably great
distances of millions of light-years from it, is still
one of the riddles of the universe which the astronomers
are attempting to solve.</p>

<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI">XVI</a><br /><br />

THE SURFACE OF THE SUN</h2>


<p>The visible surface of the sun is called the <i>photosphere</i>.
Even the smallest telescopes will show its
peculiar "rice-grain" structure, consisting of intensely
brilliant flecks or nodules about 500 miles in diameter,
which can be resolved by the more powerful telescopes
into smaller particles about 100 miles in diameter,
against a darker background. It has been estimated
that these bright nodules or rice-grains occupy only
one-fifth of the total surface of the sun, yet radiate
three-fourths of the total light.</p>

<p>It is generally believed that the "rice grains" are
the summits of highly heated columns of gas, arising
from the sun's interior, and that the darker portions
between are cooler descending currents.</p>

<p>It is well known that the photosphere or visible
surface of the sun appears to be much brighter in the
center of the disk than near its circumference. This is
due entirely to its gaseous nature and to the fact that
it is surrounded by an atmosphere of dense enveloping
cooler gases. Rays from the center of the disk travel
a shorter distance through this atmosphere than the rays
from the rim and therefore are absorbed less by surrounding
gases. We look further down into the sun's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
interior near the center of the disk than in the direction
of its circumference and so the light appears
more intense there.</p>

<p>The photosphere is the region where sun-spots appear
and they are found in zones extending from 8° to 35°
on either side of the solar equator, never appearing exactly
at the equator or near the poles.</p>

<p>The disturbances that produce sun-spots and many
allied phenomena occur cyclically in periods of eleven
years on the average. The first outburst of the disturbance
is manifested by the appearance of sun-spots
in high solar latitudes. These break out and disappear
and break out again with increased vigor, working
gradually downward toward the solar equator, the
maximum spottedness for a given period occurring in
solar latitude about 16°. The disturbance finally dies
out within 8° or 10° of the equator, but even before
one cycle of disturbance has entirely passed away a
new cycle has broken forth in high latitudes. So during
the period of minimum spottedness there are four
distinct belts, two in low latitudes, due to the dying disturbance,
and two in high latitudes, due to the new disturbance.
At sun-spot maximums there are two well-marked
zones of great intensity, approximately 16°
north and south of the sun's equator.</p>

<p>Sun-spots are solar cyclones, occurring usually in
groups, though large single spots appear less frequently.
Each spot is quite sharply divided into an umbra and a
penumbra. The umbra is the darker central portion,
the funnel of the whirling cyclone, and the penumbra is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
composed of the outspreading gases, and is less dark
than the umbra. The peculiar "thatch-straw" structure
of the penumbra is due, it is believed, to the fact that
the columns of gases that usually rise vertically from
the sun's interior and from the "rice grains" of the
photosphere are drawn into a horizontal position by
the whirling motion that exists in the penumbra regions
of a sun-spot and therefore we get a longitudinal rather
than a cross sectional view of them.</p>

<p>The umbra of a sun-spot is anywhere from a few
hundred miles to fifty thousand miles in diameter, frequently
exceeding the earth in size, while the penumbra
occasionally reaches a diameter of two hundred thousand
miles. Sun-spots of exceptional size can be seen
even without the aid of a telescope.</p>

<p>The darkness of sun-spots is only by comparison with
their more brilliant background. Owing to the rapid
expansion and cooling of gases the temperature in sun-spot
regions is far below the normal solar temperature
of 6,000° Centigrade, lying between 3,000° and 4,000°
Centigrade. At this temperature it is possible for the
more refractory chemical compounds to form, the oxides
and the hydrides, and the spectra of sun-spots reveal
the presence of titanium oxide and magnesium
and calcium hydride. At the higher solar temperatures
that exist elsewhere in the photosphere and in its overlying
gaseous envelopes all chemical elements occur in a
free state, intermingling as incandescent vapors without
the formation of any chemical compounds.</p>

<p>Strong magnetic fields exist in sun-spot regions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
magnetic storms in our own atmosphere frequently accompany
the appearance of exceptionally large sun-spots.</p>

<p>Directly above the photosphere of the sun lies the
"reversing layer," which is about five hundred miles
in depth and is composed of the incandescent vapors
of all the chemical elements that exist on the sun, which
are also the same familiar elements that exist on the
earth, with the exception of coronium, the unknown
element in the solar corona, there is no element in the
sun that has not been found on our own planet.</p>

<p>The "reversing layer" receives its name from the
fact that it reverses the solar spectrum. It produces
by its absorption of the rays of light from gases below
the dark absorption lines found in the spectrum that
serve to identify all the elements existing in the sun.
During the time immediately preceding and following
a total eclipse of the sun this reversing layer produces
what is known as the flash spectrum. When the photosphere,
which gives the bright continuous background
of the solar spectrum, is concealed by the moon, the
normally dark lines of the reversing layer&mdash;dark only
by contrast with the bright background&mdash;become momentarily
intensely bright lines against a dark background.
The flash spectrum only lasts a second or
so, as the reversing layer itself is soon covered by the
moon.</p>

<p>Just above the reversing layer lies the <i>chromosphere</i>,
which is between five thousand and ten thousand miles
in depth. Many of the gaseous vapors of the reversing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
layer are found in the chromosphere, thrown there continually
by the vast upheavals of gases that are constantly
disturbing the surface of the sun. The greater
the solar activity the more is the chromosphere charged
with the vapors of the lower strata of the sun's atmosphere.
The gases that are most characteristic of the
chromosphere, however, are the incandescent gases of
hydrogen and calcium, which give it the pink or reddish
tinge so noticeable during total solar eclipse. Helium is
also found in great abundance in the solar chromosphere.</p>

<p>Shooting upward from the photosphere with the
tremendous velocity of one hundred or more miles per
second, can be seen at all times, by properly screening
off the light from the photosphere, the vast solar eruptions
known as the <i>prominences</i>. These are composed
chiefly of hydrogen and calcium gas, though other elements
also appear, especially near the bases of the prominences.
Prominences are of two varieties, the quiescent,
or cloud-like prominences, that float high above the solar
surface for days at a time in some instances and resemble
terrestrial clouds in form, and the eruptive, or metallic
prominences, that dart up from the surface of the
sun in an infinite variety of forms that may be entirely
changed in the short interval of fifteen or twenty
minutes.</p>

<p>These eruptive prominences usually attain heights of
thirty or forty thousand miles on the average, but <i>exceptional
prominences reach heights of more than one
hundred thousand miles and in a few rare cases have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
reached elevations of over five hundred thousand miles,
or more than one-half of the solar diameter</i>.</p>

<p>Prominences are the most spectacular and beautiful
of all solar phenomena, with the possible exception of
the solar corona, which is the outermost of all the solar
envelopes and also the most tenuous. The extent of
the corona is enormous. Its outer streamers extend
usually to distances of several million miles from the
center of the sun. Measurements of the coronal light
during total eclipses of the sun have shown that its
intensity is only about one-half that of full moonlight,
and it seems almost impossible to devise methods for
detecting it, except during total eclipses, on account of
the extreme faintness of its light.</p>

<p>The sun, it is now known, is surrounded by a strong
magnetic field in addition to the magnetic fields that exist
in sun-spots. The cycle of sun-spot change is attended
by marked changes in many forms of solar
activity. The frequency of outbursts of eruptive prominences,
the brightness and form of the corona, magnetic
storms and weather changes on the earth are all
closely associated with the sun-spot cycle.</p>

<p>The cause of this sun-spot cycle, with all the attendant
changes in the general solar activity, and the
source of the apparently limitless supply of solar energy
still remain the two chief unsolved secrets of the sun.</p>

THE SOLAR SYSTEM</h2>


<p>Our sun is but a star traveling through the universe.
It is accompanied in its journey to unknown parts
of space, that lie in the general direction of the constellation
Hercules, by an extensive family of minor bodies
consisting of the eight planets and their encircling
moons, one thousand or more asteroids, numerous comets,
and meteors without number, all moving in prescribed
paths around their ruler.</p>

<p>The most important members of the sun's family are
the planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, named in the order of
their position outward from the sun. We hear occasionally
of the possibility of the existence of intra-Mercurial
and trans-Neptunian planets and it is possible that some
day an additional planet may be discovered within the
orbit of Mercury or beyond the orbit of Neptune. The
gravitational control of the sun extends far beyond the
orbit of Neptune and there are reasons for believing in
the existence of at least one or two additional planets
on the outskirts of the solar system. The existence of
a planet within the orbit of Mercury is now, after long
continued and diligent search, believed to be very
doubtful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Were it possible to view the sun from the distance
of the nearest star with the aid of the greatest telescope
on earth all the members of his family would be hopelessly
invisible. So, also, we cannot tell as we point our
powerful telescopes at the stars whether these other suns
are attended by planet families. We may only argue
that it is very unlikely that there should be only one
star among hundreds of millions that is attended by
a group of comparatively small dark bodies that shine
by the reflected light from the star they encircle.</p>

<p>With the exception of the two planets, Mercury and
Venus, which are known as the inferior planets, since
their paths lie between the earth and the sun, all the
planets have moons or satellites of their own that encircle
the planet just as the planet encircles the sun.</p>

<p>Our planet earth has one satellite, the moon, that
has the distinction of being the largest of all the moons
in proportion to the size of the planet it encircles.
Jupiter and Saturn have moons that surpass our moon in
actual size; in fact, two of the moons of the outer
planets are actually larger than the smallest planet Mercury,
but they are very small in proportion to the size of
the planets around which they revolve. Mars, the next
planet beyond the earth, the nearest of the superior or
outer planets, has two tiny moons that bear the names
of Deimos and Phobos, respectively. They are both
less than twenty miles in diameter and revolve very
near to the surface of Mars. They can only be seen
with the aid of very powerful telescopes. The inner
moon, Phobos, is unique in the solar system for it makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
three trips around Mars while the planet is turning once
on its axis.</p>

<p>Jupiter, the next planet outward from the sun, is almost
a sun itself to its extensive family of nine moons.
Four of these moons were first seen about three hundred
years ago when Galileo pointed his first crude telescope
at the heavens and any one can now see them with the
aid of an opera glass. One of the four is equal in size
to our own moon; the others surpass it in size. These
moons are most interesting little bodies to observe. Their
eclipses in the shadow of Jupiter, occultations or disappearances
behind his disk, and the transits of the shadows
as well as the moons themselves across the face of
the planet can be easily seen even with the smallest telescope.
The five remaining moons have all been discovered
in modern times. They are extremely small
bodies visible only in large telescopes. Satellite V is the
nearest of all the moons to Jupiter. The other four
are at great distances from the planet.</p>

<p>The planet Saturn has nine moons. Titan, the largest,
is nearly equal in size to Jupiter's largest moon, and is
larger than Mercury; four of the other moons have
diameters between one thousand and two thousand
miles in length. Since Saturn is nearly twice as far
from the sun as Jupiter his moons are more difficult to
observe, though the two largest are visible in small
telescopes.</p>

<p>Saturn is unique in the solar system in possessing in
addition to his nine satellites a most wonderful ring
system, composed of swarms of minute moonlets, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
pursuing its individual path around the planet. It is
this unusual ring system that makes Saturn the most interesting
to observe telescopically of all the planets.</p>

<p>The planet Uranus has four satellites and Neptune
one. These planets and their satellites cannot be
well observed on account of their great distances from
the earth. The indistinctness of surface markings
makes it impossible to determine the period of rotation
of these two outer planets on their axes. It is believed
that their rotation is very rapid, however, as is the
case with the other planets Jupiter and Saturn.</p>

<p>All the planets in the solar system fall naturally into
two groups. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, the
members of the outer group, have on the average, diameters
ten times as great and, therefore, volumes one
thousand times as great as Mercury, Venus, Earth and
Mars, the members of the inner or terrestrial group.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>: The reader must bear in mind that the telescopic views
of the four planets have not been reduced to the same scale and
so are not to be compared in size.</p></blockquote>


<p>The terrestrial planets are the pigmies of the solar
system, the outer planets are the giants. The densities
of the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are
several times greater than the density of water. They
are all extremely heavy bodies for their size, and probably
have rigid interiors with surface crusts.</p>

<p>The existence of life on Mercury is made impossible
by the absence of an atmosphere. Venus and Mars
both have atmospheres and it is possible that both of
these planets may support life. Mars has probably been
the most discussed of all the planets, though Venus is
the Earth's twin planet in size, mass, density and surface
gravity, just as Uranus and Neptune are the twins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of the outer group. It is now believed that water and
vegetation exist on Mars. The reddish color of this
planet is supposed to be due to its extensive desert
tracts. The nature of certain peculiar markings on this
planet, known as canals, still continues to be a matter of
dispute. It is generally believed since air, water and
vegetation exist on Mars, that some form of animal life
also exists there.</p>

<p>The length of the day on Mars is known very accurately,
for the rareness of its atmosphere permits us
to see readily many of its surface markings. The length
of the day is about twenty-four and one-half hours, and
the seasonal changes on Mars strongly resemble our
own, though the seasons on Mars are twice as long
as they are on our own planet since the Martian year is
twice as long as the terrestrial year.</p>

<p>The question of life on Venus depends largely upon
the length of the planet's rotation period. This is still
uncertain since no definite surface markings can be
found on the planet by which the period of its rotation
can be determined. So dense is the atmosphere of
Venus that its surface is, apparently, always hidden
from view beneath a canopy of clouds. It is the more
general belief that Venus, as well as Mercury, rotates
on its axis in the same time that it takes to make a
revolution around the sun. In this case the same side
of the planet is always turned toward the sun and, as
a result, the surface is divided into two hemispheres&mdash;one
of perpetual day, the other of perpetual night.</p>

<p>This peculiar form of rotation in which the period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of rotation and revolution are equal is by no means unknown
in the solar system. Our own moon always
keeps the same face turned toward the earth and there
are reasons for believing that some of the satellites
of Jupiter and Saturn rotate in the same manner.</p>

<p>Life on any one of the outer planets is impossible.
The density of these planets averages about the same
as the density of the sun, which is a little higher than
the density of water. The density of Saturn is even
less than water. In other words, Saturn would float
in water and it is the lightest of all the planets. It
is assumed from these facts that the four outer planets
are largely in a gaseous condition. They all possess
dense atmospheres and, in spite of their huge size,
rotate on their axis with great rapidity. The two
whose rotation periods are known, Jupiter and Saturn,
turn on their axis in about ten hours. On account of
this rapid rotation and their gaseous condition both
Jupiter and Saturn are noticeably flattened at the poles.</p>

<p>The terrestrial planets are separated from the outer
group by a wide gap. Within this space are to be
found the asteroid or planetoid group. There are
known to be over nine hundred and fifty of these minor
bodies whose diameters range from five hundred miles
for the largest to three or four miles for the smallest.
There are only four asteroids whose diameters exceed
one hundred miles and the majority have diameters of
less than twenty miles. The total mass of the asteroids
is much less than that of the smallest of the planets. It
was believed at one time that these small bodies were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
fragments of a shattered planet, but this view is no
longer held. The asteroids as well as the comets and
meteors probably represent the material of the primitive
solar nebula that was not swept up when the
larger planets were formed.</p>

<p>With few exceptions the asteroids are only to be
seen in large telescopes and then only as star-like points
of light. Most of them are simply huge rocks and all
are necessarily devoid of life since such small bodies
have not sufficient gravitational force to hold an
atmosphere.</p>

<p>The revolution of the planets around the sun and of
the satellites of the planets around the primary planets
are performed according to known laws of motion that
make it possible to foretell the positions of these bodies
years in advance. Asteroids and comets also obey these
same laws, and after three observations of the positions
of one of these bodies have been obtained its future movements
can be predicted. All the planets and their satellites
are nearly perfect spheres. They all, with few exceptions,
rotate on their axes and revolve around the sun,
or, in the case of moons, around their primaries, in the
same direction, from west to east. Only the two outermost
satellites of Jupiter, the outermost satellites of Saturn
and the satellites of Uranus and Neptune retrograde
or travel in their orbits from east to west, which is
opposite to the direction of motion of all the other planets
and satellites.</p>

<p>The paths of all the planets around the sun are
ellipses that are nearly circular, and they all lie nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
in the same plane. The asteroids have orbits that are
more flattened or elliptical and these orbits are in some
instances highly inclined to the planetary orbits. The
comets have orbits that are usually very elongated ellipses
or parabolas. Some of the comets may be only
chance visitors to our solar system, though astronomers
generally believe that they are all permanent members.
Paths of comets pass around the sun at all angles and
some comets move in their orbits from west to east,
while others move in the opposite direction or retrograde.
The behavior of the asteroids and comets is not at all in
accord with the theory that was, until recently, universally
advanced to explain the origin of the solar
system.</p>

<p>Some astronomers have made attempts to modify the
nebular hypothesis that has held sway for so many
years, in order to make it fit in with more recent discoveries,
but others feel that a new theory is now required
to explain the origin of the solar system. Several
theories have been advanced but no new theory has
yet definitely replaced the famous nebular hypothesis
of the noted French astronomer La Place.</p>

<h2><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII">XVIII</a><br /><br />

THE ORIGIN OF THE EARTH</h2>


<p>It is not possible to consider the question of the
origin of the earth apart from the question of the origin
of the solar system. That all the planets, as well
as the asteroids, originated from a common parent-mass
has never been seriously questioned. All of these
bodies revolve about the sun, and rotate upon their
axes in the same direction&mdash;from west to east. Moreover,
all of the planetary orbits lie very nearly in the
same plane and are nearly circular in form.</p>

<p>The orbits of the asteroids are more elliptical and more
highly inclined to one another than are the orbits
of the planets, but on the average they are neither very
elliptical nor very highly inclined to the planetary orbits.</p>

<p>The sun rotates upon its axis in the same direction
in which the planets rotate and perform their revolutions,
and the orbits of the planets are inclined at small
angles to the plane of the sun's equator.</p>

<p>These facts are all significant and cannot be overlooked
in formulating a theory to explain the origin
of the planetary system in general and of the earth
in particular. Presumably the planets and asteroids
formed at one time a part of a central body which rotated
on its axis in the direction in which they now
revolve about the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>When and by the operation of what force, external
or internal, they were separated from this central body
is the question.</p>

<p>In 1796 La Place advanced his celebrated <i>nebular
hypothesis</i> to explain the origin of the solar system. It
was received with favor both by scientists and laymen,
and in a short time was almost universally accepted as
closely approximating to the truth.</p>

<p>According to the nebular hypothesis the solar nebula
from which the planetary system was formed, originally
extended at least as far as the orbit of Neptune and
rotated slowly in the direction in which the planets now
revolve. As it lost heat by radiation and contracted under
the gravitation of its parts its rate of rotation increased.
When the centrifugal (center-fleeing) force
at the equator equalled the gravitational force directed
toward the center, a ring would be left behind by the
contracting nebula. Such a ring would not be absolutely
uniform and would break at some point and gather into
a planetary mass under the gravitation of its parts. This
planetary mass would abandon rings in turn and these
would break up to form satellites. Successive rings
were supposed to have been abandoned at intervals by
the solar nebula at the present distances of the planets
from the sun in the manner described above until the
original solar nebula had contracted to its present size.</p>

<p>The rings of Saturn were supposed to be the single
example remaining of this process of forming planets
and satellites from a <i>contracting nebulous mass</i>.</p>

<p>The La Placian hypothesis attempted to explain why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
all the planets and their satellites revolve in the same
direction in which the sun turns on its axis, in nearly
circular orbits and nearly in the same plane. At the
time it was advanced it appeared to be in accord with
all the facts then known regarding the solar system.</p>

<p>The planetoids with their interlacing and in some instances
highly inclined and elliptical orbits were then
undiscovered. It would have been impossible for them
to have been formed by the abandonment of successive
rings from a central, rotating mass.</p>

<p>The constitution of Saturn's rings was unknown at
this time; also the fact that the moonlets of the inner
ring revolve about Saturn in <em>half</em> the time required for
the planet to turn on its axis&mdash;another impossibility
under the nebular hypothesis, for, according to the
assumptions of the nebular hypothesis it would be impossible
for a satellite to revolve about a central body
in a shorter time than that body turns on its axis.</p>

<p>The satellites of Mars were not discovered until many
years later, as well as the retrograding satellites of
Jupiter and Saturn, all presenting difficulties in the way
of accepting the nebular hypothesis without radical
changes. Attempts, mostly unsuccessful, have been
made from time to time to make these exceptional cases
fit in with the requirements of the nebular hypothesis.</p>

<p>The theory that the sun's heat was maintained by
the contraction of the original solar nebula, which
would cause its temperature to rise, appeared to give
considerable support to the theory of La Place, but the
mathematicians got to work and showed that the amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of heat that would be furnished by the contraction of
the sun from beyond the orbit of Neptune to its present
dimensions would be sufficient to supply heat to the
earth at the present rate for only twenty-five million
years, a period far too brief, the geologists and biologists
said, to cover all the vast cyclical changes that
are known to have taken place upon the surface of this
planet since its surface crust was formed. Evidently
gravitational contraction is by no means the only or
even the chief source of the sun's heat.</p>

<p>It was also shown indisputably, that it would have
been impossible for successive rings to have been abandoned
at certain definite intervals by a contracting
nebula, and granted a ring could have been formed it
would have been impossible for it to condense into a
planet, since forces residing in the sun would offset
the gravitation of its parts.</p>

<p>When La Place advanced his famous theory it was,
to use his own words, "with that distrust which everything
ought to inspire that is not a result of observation
or of calculation."</p>

<p>Were La Place living today he would be, we believe,
the first to abandon a theory that is now known to
be in accord neither with observation nor calculation.</p>

<p>Deprived of a theory that has served to explain the
outstanding features of the solar system more or less
adequately for one hundred and twenty-five years, astronomers
are seeking in the light of recent observations
and discoveries to formulate a satisfactory theory of
the origin of the solar system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>In the planetesimal theory of Chamberlin and Moulton
and the recently suggested theory of the well-known
English mathematician, Jeans, <i>a second sun passing
close to our own sun is assumed to have been the cause
of the origin of the planetary system</i>.</p>

<p>The effect of the close approach of such a sun would
be the ejection of a stream of matter from our sun, as
we term it, in the direction of the passing body and also
in a diametrically opposite direction. This ejection
would be continuous as long as the stars remained near
one another, the height attained by the ejected stream
decreasing as the passing star receded. The result would
be the formation of a <i>spiral nebula</i> in which the motion
of the ejected particles&mdash;planetesimals&mdash;would be across
the spiral arms, toward and away from the passing
star. After the sun had receded so far as to have no
further effect upon these ejected particles they would revolve
about the sun in more or less elliptical orbits
which would gradually be reduced to nearly circular
forms by repeated collisions between planetesimals.
Larger nuclei would be formed and these would gradually
sweep up smaller fragments and become the planets
of the present system. Smaller nuclei in the vicinity of
larger ones would become their satellites and in the
course of many millions of years all of the larger fragments
would be swept up by the planetary nuclei and
their satellites&mdash;leaving only the asteroids, comets and
meteors as survivors of the original spiral system.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that a spiral nebula formed
by the close approach of two suns would resemble in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
form only the great spiral nebulæ that are known to
exist by hundreds of thousands in the heavens. These
are far too extensive to form anything so small as a
single solar system, but might condense into systems
composed of many suns&mdash;either galaxies or star
clusters.</p>

<p>Jean's suggested theory of the origin of the planetary
system differs in its details from the above, though a
passing sun is assumed to be the disturbing force that
causes the ejection of a stream of matter which condenses
to form the planets and their satellites. The
origin of the inner planets is left greatly in doubt by
this theory, however, and the system which interests
us chiefly&mdash;the earth-moon system&mdash;is the one about
which it is most difficult to arrive at any definite conclusion.
Our own sun, it is assumed, was dark and
cold, of low density and with a diameter about equal
to that of Neptune's orbit at the time of the catastrophe
which is placed at some 300,000,000 years ago. In
Jean's words, "... The time for arriving at conclusions
in cosmogony has not yet come&mdash;and it must
be left to future investigators armed with more mathematical
and observational knowledge than we at present
possess to pronounce a final decision."</p>

<p>However, since La Place advanced his celebrated
nebular hypothesis, great advances in astronomy have
been made, and man is in a better position to theorize
on this fascinating problem today than he was one hundred
and twenty-five years ago.</p>

<p>All such theories must necessarily be regarded as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
working hypotheses only, to be discarded or modified
as our knowledge and understanding of the laws of the
universe increase. No theory can ever be regarded as
final or perfect.</p>

<p>The discovery of radio-activity furnishes us with
new material for new theories. The sun and the planets
may be and probably are far older than we ever dreamed
could be possible. It is no longer necessary or reasonable
to assume that a greatly extended solar nebula once
existed and supplied the planets with heat through
gravitational contraction or to place a time limit upon
the period required for the formation of the planets
and their satellites that is not in accord with the requirements
of other sciences.</p>

<p>We know today that there exist within the sun powerful
repulsive forces, which even under present conditions
occasionally eject gaseous matter to heights of five
hundred thousand miles or more with a velocity of
over two hundred miles per second. Small changes in
the velocity of ejection produce great differences in the
height of the ejected columns.</p>

<p>With an initial velocity of three hundred and eighty
miles per second, matter would be thrown from the
solar surface to a height of fifty million miles. Were
the velocity of ejection three hundred and eighty-three
miles per second the height of the column would be
five hundred million miles, while a further increase
in the initial velocity would send matter away from
the sun, never to return.</p>

<p>Instead of suns and solar systems evolved from nebulæ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
we are now more familiar with the idea of nebulæ
evolved from stars through some terrific cataclysm as
in the case of novas or temporary stars.</p>

<p>It is now known that there exist in certain parts
of space a number of sharply defined stars surrounded
by extensive nebulous envelopes. Are these possibly
suns that are going through the process of forming
their planetary systems?</p>

<p>It is now known that pressure of light and electrical
repulsion are forces to be reckoned with in the evolution
of stars and nebulæ as well as gravitational contraction.
It has long been felt that the peculiar formations existing
among the vast irregular gaseous nebulæ could not
be explained as gravitational effects alone.</p>

<p><i>Light-pressure and electrical repulsion</i>, as well as
<i>gravitation</i> are at work within the solar system and
the sun is the seat of powerful disturbances which produce
periodic outbursts of exceptional activity and which
may have produced in the distant past more startling
effects than any with which we are familiar at present.</p>

<p>The earth and moon form a system that is in a way
unique. No satellite in the solar system is so large
in proportion to its primary as is our own moon.
Seen from the distance of Venus or Mars, the two
bodies would apparently form a <i>double star</i>. The diameter
of the moon is one-fourth that of the earth. Satellite
III of Jupiter far exceeds our own moon in actual
size but its diameter is only about four-hundredths
of the diameter of the planet about which it revolves.
The diameter of Titan, the largest satellite of the Saturnian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
system, bears the same ratio to the diameter of
Saturn. Moreover, all the nearer satellites of Jupiter
and Saturn lie nearly in the equatorial planes of these
planets, but the orbit of the moon is inclined at a high
angle to the plane of the earth's equator.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to believe that the satellites of Jupiter
or Saturn were at some time thrown off from the
equatorial belts of their primaries, just as the planets
themselves may have been ejected from the equatorial
belt of the sun, but we cannot so readily believe that
our own satellite was formed from the earth in a similar
manner.</p>

<p>The moon's orbit lies nearly in the plane of the sun's
equator, however, and it is conceivable that both earth
and moon were simultaneously ejected from the equatorial
zone of the sun, the two nuclei being so close
together that the smaller one remained under the
gravitational control of the larger.</p>

<p>The difficulties in the way of believing that the moon
once formed a part of the earth are very great. It
can be shown mathematically that if the two bodies
at one time formed a single mass it would have been
impossible for the moon to break away from the earth,
unless the force that caused the separation were sufficient
to hurl the moon to a greater distance than two
and a half times the earth's radius. The mathematician,
Roche, found out by computation that a satellite
could not remain intact within this distance of the
planet, but would be broken up into small fragments
under the effects of the tides raised by the larger body.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
If, then, the moon had originally been ejected from the
earth to a less distance than two and one-half radii of
the earth (2.44 to be exact) it would have been disintegrated
into small particles, or moonlets, under the tidal
strains exerted upon it by the earth and would have
been gradually distributed about the earth in the form
of a meteoric ring which, in the course of ages, would
be absorbed by the earth, just as Saturn is now gradually
absorbing its rings.</p>

<p>The planets differ greatly in density. The more distant
and larger planets&mdash;Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
Neptune&mdash;have densities equal to or less than that of the
sun. The densities of the inner planets&mdash;Mercury,
Venus, Earth and Mars&mdash;are, relatively, extremely high,
the density of the Earth's core being about that of
meteoric iron. The densities of Mercury and Venus
are slightly less than that of the earth and the densities
of Mars and the moon about equal to that of the earth's
crust.</p>

<p>If a stream of matter were ejected from the sun under
the influence of some external force, such as that
exerted by a passing star, the outlying parts of the
stream would consist of the lighter elements and the
lower parts of the heavier elements, since the lighter
solar elements lie at or near the surface of the sun and
the heavier elements at greater depths. At the time of
ejection the lighter elements would be thrown to great
distances and would go to form the less dense outer
planets; the heavier elements would go to form the inner
planets of high density.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>It is conceivable that ejection of solar material might
have taken place under the influence of certain forces
at work within the sun itself, such as electrical repulsion
or pressure of light which might become powerful
enough under certain conditions to overcome the effect
of gravitation.</p>

<p>Next to nothing is known about the physical state
of matter at great solar depths, where abnormal conditions
of temperature and pressure must exist, and where
great physical changes and disturbances may have taken
place in the past. Even today solar activity goes
through a cycle of change during the sun-spot period,
and many millions of years ago the sun-spot cycle of
solar activity may have been far different from what
it is today and a far more powerful factor in producing
changes in the solar system.</p>

<p>Outbursts of novas indicate that agencies making for
peace and order are not the only ones at work among
the stars. The cause of such outbursts has never been
satisfactorily explained. The theory that they are
caused by the close approach of two suns or by the
encounter of a star with a dark nebula does not account
for all of the circumstances of such outbursts.
The nebulous matter seen about a nova after the outburst
is now generally believed to have been expelled
from the star itself at the time of the catastrophe and
may conceivably be the stuff of which planetary systems
are made.</p>

<p>At some epoch in the past, probably at least one
thousand million years ago, our own sun may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
undergone some cataclysmic change and this may,
conceivably, have been brought about by disturbances
within the sun itself. Elements may have been so
formed and distributed within the interior of the sun
that friction and internal instability resulted and in
time produced an upheaval of solar elements with
initial velocities so great that, possibly, through electrical
repulsion and light-pressure, portions of the
ejected streams were permanently detached from the
sun and became the nuclei of future planets. In some
such way, it is conceivable, our own planet Earth and the
other members of our solar system may have been
brought into existence in the dim and distant past&mdash;many
hundred million years ago.</p>

JUPITER AND HIS NINE MOONS</h2>


<p>Jupiter shines by reflected sunlight with a brilliancy
that usually exceeds that of the brightest
of the stars, Sirius. When seen during the midnight
hours the remarkable unflickering brightness of this
largest and most distinguished member of the solar
system at once serves to set it apart from the scintillating
stars far beyond.</p>

<p>There is but one planet, Venus, that always surpasses
Jupiter in brilliancy, though Mars on the
occasions of its close approaches to the earth may
equal or slightly surpass Jupiter in brightness. As
Venus never departs more than forty-eight degrees
from the sun, and so is never seen in the midnight
hours, Jupiter usually shines without a rival when visible
at midnight. To one who has observed the two planets
together the silvery radiance and surpassing brilliancy
of Venus, due not to its size, but to its comparative
nearness to the earth, at once serves to distinguish it
from the golden glow of Jupiter.</p>

<p>Even the smallest telescopes of two- or three-inch
aperture will show the four historic moons of Jupiter
which were the first celestial objects to be discovered
when Galileo turned his crude telescope to the heavens
in the year 1610.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>The fact that these tiny points of light were actually
revolving around the great planet was soon detected
by the famous astronomer and we can imagine with
what breathless interest he observed these satellites
of another world whose discovery dealt such a severe
blow to the old Ptolemaic theory that the earth was
the center of the universe. It was not until the
great telescopes of modern times were invented that
the five additional moons of Jupiter were discovered.
The four satellites first observed by Galileo were fancifully
named Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, in
the order of their positions outward from the planet,
but these names are rarely used now, the satellites
being designated for convenience I, II, III and IV,
respectively. The first of the new satellites to be
discovered was Satellite V, which is the nearest to Jupiter
of all the nine moons. It is an extremely small
body, not more than one hundred miles in diameter, and
to discover this tiny body as it skirted rapidly around
the great planet within sixty-seven thousand miles of
its surface, nearly lost in the glaring rays, was a difficult
feat even for an experienced observer. It was
accomplished, however, by Prof. E. E. Barnard with
the great Lick refractor in 1892. Satellite V is
hopelessly beyond the reach of any but the greatest
telescopes, as are also the four satellites discovered
since that date. In fact, most of these tiny moons
are observed photographically. Satellites VI and VII
were discovered photographically in 1905. They are
both about seven million miles from the planet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
their paths loop through one another; they are, moreover,
highly inclined to each other at an angle of
nearly thirty degrees. When nearest together they
are separated by a distance of two million miles. Two
more extremely small bodies, known as Satellites VIII
and IX, have been discovered since then, one at
Greenwich, England, in 1908, the other at the Lick
Observatory in 1914. These excessively faint bodies
are the most remote satellites of Jupiter and they are
of particular interest because they travel around the
planet in a retrograde direction, or from east to west,
which is <em>opposite</em> to the direction of revolution prevailing
in the solar system. The ninth and most distant
satellite of Saturn also retrogrades, or revolves in a
clockwise rather than a counter-clockwise direction
around the planet. One explanation given for this
peculiarity of the outermost satellites of Jupiter and
Saturn is that this backward revolution around the
planet is more stable when the satellites are at great
distances from the primary, and the gravitational control
that the planet exerts is therefore weak. The
moons of the planets are, of course, subject to the
attraction of the sun as well as to the attraction of
the controlling planet, and the greater the distance of
the satellite from the planet the stronger the pull
exerted by the sun and the weaker the bonds that bind
the moon to the planet. Beyond a certain limit
it would be impossible for the planet to hold the satellite
against the sun's greater attraction and the satellite
would leave the planet to revolve directly around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the sun, thereby becoming a planet. It appears that
as this danger limit is neared it is safer for the satellite
to "back" around the planet than to follow the
usual "west to east" direction of revolution. The
eighth satellite of Jupiter is more than fourteen million
and the ninth more than fifteen million miles
from the parent planet and they require about two
years and three years, respectively, to complete one
trip around Jupiter. When we consider that Satellite
V darts around the planet in less than twelve hours at
a distance of only sixty-seven thousand miles from
its surface we realise what tremendous differences exist
in the distances and periods of revolution of the nine
moons. There is also great disparity in the sizes of
the various moons. The five moons discovered in
modern times are all excessively faint and extremely
small. The diameter of the largest of these,
Satellite V, is less than one hundred miles. On the
other hand, the four historic moons of Jupiter are of
planetary dimensions. The smallest, Satellite II, is
slightly larger than our own moon, while the largest,
Satellite III, has a diameter, according to measurements
made with the 40-inch Yerkes refractor in 1916, of
three thousand nine hundred and eight miles, which
is only four hundred miles less than the diameter of
Mars. The periods of revolution of these four satellites
range from one day and eighteen hours for the
nearest, which is about two hundred and sixty-one
thousand miles from the center of Jupiter, to sixteen
days and sixteen and one-half hours for the most distant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
which is more than one million one hundred and
sixty thousand miles from the planet. These four
moons are so near to the great planet that they are
continually dipping into his huge shadow and experiencing
an eclipse of the sun which, owing to the nearness
and great size of Jupiter, lasts for two or three
hours. At times of eclipse the moon suddenly disappears
from the observer's view, though it may be
considerably to one side of the planet. Its reappearance
later on is just as sudden, or it may pass out of
the shadow while hidden from us behind the disk of
the planet, in which case its reappearance is invisible
from the earth. The occultations of the satellites, or,
in other words, their disappearance behind the planet's
disk, are also interesting phenomena to observe, as
are their "transits" across the disk of the planet as
the satellite passes in front of it. Not only the
satellite itself but its shadow as well can be seen,
a small black dot passing over the surface of Jupiter.
The satellite is totally eclipsing the sun for this
small dark portion of the planet's disk. Two
satellites and their shadows are frequently seen crossing
the face of the planet at the same time. It
is possible to observe all the phenomena of the satellite's
transits and shadows, eclipses and occultations
with very small telescopes. From observations of the
eclipses of Jupiter's satellites the important discovery
of the finite velocity of light was first made as far
back as the year 1675.</p>

<p>Faint surface markings have been made out at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
certain times on the largest of the four satellites,
Satellite III, and also on Satellite I. Observations of
the markings on the former seem to indicate that it
always keeps the same face turned toward Jupiter as
does our own moon toward the earth.</p>

<p>There are also reasons for believing that the equatorial
regions of Satellite I are light colored and the
polar regions dark. There is the possibility that forms
of life may exist on these satellites of Jupiter, though
they are more likely barren, lifeless worlds, such as
Mercury and the moon. Their great distance from the
earth, never less than three hundred and sixty-eight
million miles, makes observations of their surface
markings very difficult.</p>

<p>How beautiful beyond description must the heavens
appear as viewed from the satellites of Jupiter!
Viewed from the distance of Io, or Satellite I, the mighty
planet Jupiter presents a spectacle such as the eye of
man has never been privileged to behold. The huge
flattened globe, ninety thousand miles in equatorial
diameter, equal in mass to <em>three hundred planets such
as our own</em> and in volume to nearly <em>fourteen hundred</em>,
fills a space in the heavens nearly twenty degrees in
extent as viewed from this satellite. Fifteen hundred
of our own full moons would hardly fill the same
space. Whirling on its axis with frightful speed in
a period of less than ten hours, the huge ball glides
rapidly but majestically onward through the sky. A
far distant sun shrunk to but one-fifth the diameter
of the full moon throws light and shade across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
rapidly changing surface of the planet, rich in the reds,
browns and yellows and all the gorgeous shades and
tints of its dense, seething, gaseous envelope. The
phases of the moon on a greatly enlarged scale rapidly
succeed each other on Jupiter as it is viewed from the
satellite in all positions with reference to the sun. The
cause of the belts of Jupiter, that lie parallel to the planet's
equator and are constantly changing in number, width
and shade, as well as the nature of all the peculiar
splashes of color and intensely white flecks that come
and go in the dense atmosphere of the planet would
not be such a mystery to us were it possible to view
the great planet from the distance of Satellite I, which is
about as far from the surface of Jupiter as the moon
is from the earth. It is uncertain whether the planet
is entirely gaseous throughout or has a central core
of solid or liquid matter. Its density is only one and
one-quarter times that of water and slightly less than that
of the sun, showing that it is composed largely, if
not entirely, of matter in a gaseous state. Jupiter is
a world as different from our own as it is possible to
imagine. There is no visible surface crust and there
are no permanent markings. Different spots on the
planet's disk give different periods of rotation showing
that it is atmospheric phenomena that we observe.
All is constant flux and change on Jupiter. Dense
vapors arise from a highly heated interior and spread
out into belts parallel to the equator in the direction
of the planet's rotation. From its nearest satellite
all the interesting changes of color and form that constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
take place in the atmosphere of this great globe
could be observed in great detail. The high percentage
of light and heat that Jupiter reflects from the sun
to its nearer satellites makes it a secondary sun to
them of tremendous size though feeble strength.</p>

<p>As seen from Satellite I the other three major
moons of Jupiter present all the phases of our own
moon in rapid succession, due to their constantly
changing positions with reference to the sun. The
five small moons, discovered in modern times, are so
minute that they are simply star-like points of light
even when viewed from the other moons of Jupiter.</p>

<p>To keep track of the rapidly changing positions and
various phases of the moons of Jupiter as seen from
any one of them, as well as the rapid <em>apparent</em> motion
of the planet through the sky due to the revolutions
of the satellite around the planet, would be a troublesome
task for an astronomer stationed on one of these
far distant worlds. It would be a common sight to
see in the sky at one time the huge planet, the far-distant,
shrunken sun, and one, two or three moons.
Seen from the moons of Jupiter the constellations
would appear as they do to us on earth, for such a
slight change in position as five hundred million miles,
more or less, is trivial when one is looking at the
stars. Observations of the stars from the nearest
moon of Jupiter would be attended with great difficulties
at times, since reflected sunlight from a body
nearly twenty degrees in diameter would be extremely
troublesome, especially were the phases of the planets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
near that of the full moon. We know how the presence
of our own moon in the heavens at the full
dims the brightness of the stars so that only the
brightest stars are seen. Even as viewed from the
fourth or most distant of the major satellites the
planet subtends an angle of nearly five degrees. Occultations
of the stars are many and frequent as the huge
planet globe glides swiftly through the heavens. Many
a moonlight night appears almost as day owing to the
presence of the enormous, brilliantly reflecting ball of
light and at times two or three moons in addition. Only
the brightest stars could possibly be seen under such
circumstances. When, however, the small worlds pass
into the shadow of the great mother planet and not
only the light of the sun but also the reflected light
of Jupiter disappears for many minutes, the stars
shine forth in all their glory there as here. At such
times some of the larger moons would usually be seen
shining by the reflected light of the far distant sun.
Saturn also would be visible as a magnificent star, but
beautiful Venus and ruddy Mars would fail to appear.
Tiny bodies, mere specks of light at this distance, they
would be lost to view in the glare of the sun.</p>

<h2><a name="XX" id="XX">XX</a><br /><br />

THE RINGS AND MOONS OF SATURN</h2>


<p>Nearly everyone has felt at some time or other
a strong desire to gaze at some of the beauties
and wonders of the heavens through a telescope and
the one object that all of us wish to see, if, perchance,
this desire is to be gratified is Saturn, whose unusual
ring system has, so far as we know, no counterpart
in the sky.</p>

<p>All the planets in the solar system with the exception
of the two innermost, Mercury and Venus, are
attended by satellites, but Saturn, alone, has in addition
to a family of nine moons, three distinct rings
of great dimensions which are composed of swarms
of minute particles revolving around the planet.</p>

<p>Why Saturn should be the only planet to possess
such a system of rings has never been explained in an
entirely satisfactory manner. There is an interesting
law known as "Roche's Law," however, named from
its investigator, that states that no satellite of a planet
can exist intact with 2.44 times the radius of
the planet. This limit is spoken of as "Roche's
Limit" and applying it to the planet Saturn we find
that the rings of Saturn fall within this limit. It does
not necessarily follow from this that the minute particles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
of which the rings are composed are the shattered
remains of one small satellite, but rather that
they are the material from which a satellite might
have been formed were it not so close to the planet.
Within "Roche's Limit" the mutual attraction of the
various particles for each other that would tend eventually
to gather them into one body is overcome by tidal
forces that arise from such close proximity to the
huge planet. The stress and strain of such forces is
so great that no grouping of particles can take place.
This explains, possibly, why the rings continue to
exist in their present condition. The total quantity of
matter in the rings is known to be very small, for
it does not disturb the motions of any of the nearer
and smaller satellites, though tiny Mimas, six hundred
miles in diameter, is only thirty-one thousand miles
beyond the outer edge of the outer ring.</p>

<p>An interesting observation was made a few years
ago of the passage of the rings of the planet between
us and a star. Though the light of the star was
diminished to one-fourth of its normal brightness
when the rings passed before it, at no time was its
light entirely eclipsed by any of the particles. It was
computed that if the diameters of any of the individual
particles had amounted to as much as three or four
miles the star would have been temporarily eclipsed.
An upper limit for the size of the moonlets was thus
obtained. The average diameter of the particles is
probably much less than three miles.</p>

<p>The thickness of the ring system is not over fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
or one hundred miles, but its total diameter is one
hundred and seventy-two thousand miles. There are,
in all, three concentric rings. The faint inner ring,
known as the "crape" ring, is invisible in a telescope
under four inches in aperture. The width of this
inner ring is eleven thousand miles. Just beyond the
crape ring is the chief, bright ring, eighteen thousand
miles in width. It shades gradually in brightness from
its juncture with the crape ring to its most luminous
portion at its outer edge, which is separated from
the third or outer ring by a gap two thousand two
hundred miles in width, known as Cassini's Division.
The third or outer ring is eleven thousand miles wide
and is less bright than the central ring. The inner edge
of the inner ring is but six thousand miles above
the surface of the planet. On account of the curvature
of the planet the ring system is invisible from the
north and south poles of Saturn. As in the case of
the satellites of a planet the inner particles of the
rings revolve around the planet more rapidly than the
outer particles. The innermost particles of the crape
ring require but five hours for one journey around
Saturn while the outermost particles of the outer
ring require one hundred and thirty-seven hours, or
nearly six days to complete one revolution.</p>

<p>In addition to the gap in the rings known as Cassini's
Division several other fainter divisions exist.
If a group of moonlets were to revolve around the
planet in the positions marked by these gaps their
periods of revolution would be commensurable with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the periods of several of the satellites of Saturn. As a
result the attraction exerted on such particles by these
satellites would gradually disturb their motion in such
a way as to draw them away from these positions.
It is owing, therefore, to the attraction of the satellites
of Saturn for the moonlets that these gaps in
the rings exist.</p>

<p>As a result of the disturbances produced in the
motion of the moonlets by the satellites of Saturn
collisions are bound to occur occasionally among the
various particles. When two particles collide the
period of revolution of one or both of them is reduced
and as a result collisions tend to bring the moonlets
gradually closer and closer to the surface of the
planet. The dusky inner ring, it is believed, may consist
largely of particles whose periods have been continually
shortened by collisions.</p>

<p>Saturn may, therefore, lose its ring system in the
course of time through its gradually being drawn down
upon the planet by collisions of the various particles
until all of the material is finally swept up by the planet.
Such a change would probably require millions of
years, however, as collisions are probably, on the
whole, infrequent. It is possible that the ring system
of Saturn may have been much more extensive in
the past than it is now and other members of our
solar system may have had such appendages in the
far distant past.</p>

<p>The appearance of the rings of Saturn as viewed
from our planet changes periodically as a result of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the revolution of the earth and Saturn around the
sun, which places them in constantly changing positions
with reference to each other. The rings lie in the
plane of Saturn's equator, which is inclined twenty-seven
degrees to its orbit and twenty-eight degrees to
the Earth's orbit.</p>

<p>Since the position of the equator remains parallel
to itself while the planet is journeying around the sun
it happens that half the time the earth is elevated
above the plane of the rings and the remainder of the
time it lies below the plane of the rings. Twice in
the period of Saturn's revolution around the sun,
which occupies nearly thirty years, the earth lies
directly in the plane of the rings and at this time the
rings entirely disappear from view for a short time.
Mid-way between the two dates of disappearance the
rings are tilted at their widest angle with reference
to the earth and they are then seen to the best advantage.
As the date of their disappearance approaches
they appear more and more like a line of light extending
to either side of the planet's equator. Even
in the most powerful telescope the rings entirely disappear
from view for a few hours at the time the earth
lies exactly in the same plane. It is at this time that
the ball of the planet is best seen. Its flattening at
the poles, which is nearly ten per cent. of its equatorial
diameter then gives it a decidedly oval appearance.
Ordinarily one of the hemispheres of Saturn is
partly or entirely concealed by the rings so that the
oblate form is not so noticeable. It was the change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
in the tilt and visibility of the rings that so perplexed
Galileo when he attempted to make out the nature
of these appendages of Saturn with his crude telescope
of insufficient magnifying power. So great was his
bewilderment when the rings finally disappeared that
he cried out in despair that Saturn must have swallowed
his children, according to the legend. He finally
became so exasperated with the results of his observations
that he gave up observing the planet. The true
nature of these appendages of Saturn remained a
mystery until Huygens solved the problem in 1655,
some time after the death of Galileo.</p>

<p>In addition to the rings, Saturn has nine satellites
named, in the order of their distance outward from
the planet, Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea,
Titan, Hyperion, Iapetus and Phoebe. The last-mentioned
satellite was discovered by W. H. Pickering
in 1899. It aroused great interest at the time because
it was the first satellite to be discovered with "retrograde"
motion in its orbit. Two satellites of Jupiter
since discovered revolve in the same direction around
their primary.</p>

<p>The satellites of Saturn are approximate to those of
Jupiter in size and exactly equal them in number.
The largest, Titan, is three thousand miles in diameter
and can be easily seen with the smallest telescopes.
With a four-inch telescope five of the satellites can
be readily found, though they are not as interesting
to observe as the satellites of Jupiter because they
are far more distant from the earth. The time they require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
to make one journey around Saturn varies from
nearly twenty-three hours for Mimas, the nearest, to
approximately five hundred and twenty-four days for
Phoebe, the most distant.</p>

<p>Saturn as well as Jupiter is marked by belts parallel
to the Equator though they appear more indistinct than
those of Jupiter on account of the greater distance
of Saturn. Saturn also resembles Jupiter in its physical
composition which is largely, if not entirely, gaseous,
and in the extremely short period of rotation on its
axis which is approximately ten hours. In more ways
than one Saturn is a very unusual planet. In addition
to possessing an enormous ring system it is the
lightest of all the planets, its density being only sixty-three
hundredths that of water, and it is the most
oblate, its flattening at the poles amounting nearly to
one-tenth of its diameter. Its equator is more highly
inclined to its orbit than is the case with any other
planet, not even excepting the earth and Mars. For
this reason its seasonal changes are very great, in
marked contrast to Jupiter whose equator lies very
nearly in the plane of its orbit. Since Saturn is so
far away from the sun that it receives only one
ninetieth as much light and heat per unit area as the
earth, its outer gaseous surface must be extremely
cold unless considerable heat is conveyed to the surface
from within its hot interior.</p>

<p>The late Prof. Lowell concluded from certain observations
made at Flagstaff, Ariz., that Saturn is
composed of layers of different densities and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
inner layers are more flattened at the poles and rotate
faster than the outer layers. Marked variations in the
color and brightness of the ball of the planet have been
noted from time to time. In 1916 observers of Saturn
described the planet as pinkish-brown and conspicuously
darker than the brighter portions of the rings.</p>

<p>It is believed that these very noticeable changes in
the color and brightness of Saturn are due to slight,
irregular changes in the intensity of the radiations of
the sun which set up certain secondary effects in the
atmosphere of the planets. Similar changes in color
and brightness have been observed also in the case
of Jupiter.</p>

<h2><a name="XXI" id="XXI">XXI</a><br /><br />

IS THE MOON A DEAD WORLD?</h2>


<p>It has been a generally accepted belief among
astronomers for years that the moon is a dead
world devoid of air and water and so, necessarily,
lifeless. It is certain that the moon has no extensive
atmosphere such as envelops our own planet. There
is abundant proof of this fact. The edge of the lunar
disk is clear-cut. Whenever, as happens frequently,
the moon passes between us and a star the disappearance
of the star is instantaneous. There is no gradual
dimming or refraction of the star's light by atmospheric
vapors. Moreover, lunar shadows are harsh and black.
There is no evidence of diffusion of light on the moon
by atmospheric gases.</p>

<p>The absence of water or water vapor on the visible
surface of the moon, at least in any appreciable quantity,
is plainly evident to anyone who observes the moon
through the telescope. Even with small telescopes,
objects five miles or so in diameter can be readily
detected and clouds drifting over the surface could
not possibly escape our observation if they existed.</p>

<p>Bodies of water, great or small, would be plainly
visible and would besides give rise to water vapor
and clouds, which we would not fail to detect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Since the surface of the moon is unscreened by
air and water vapor to absorb the incoming rays from
the sun, and the outgoing radiations from the surface,
the extremes of temperature between day and night
are very great, and are augmented by the fact that
the lunar day equals the lunar month in length, so
that fourteen days of untempered heat are followed by
fourteen days of frigid darkness. Observations of the
rate of radiation from the moon's surface during total
eclipses of the moon indicate that the moon's radiation
is very rapid, and that its temperature during the height
of the lunar day probably approaches 200° F., while
at the lunar midnight it may have fallen to 100°
below zero F., or even lower.</p>

<p>With air and water both lacking and such extremes
of temperature existing why should we seriously consider
the question of life on the moon?</p>

<p>This is the point of view of the majority of astronomers
and it seems well taken. Yet many astronomers
who have made a special study of the lunar surface
for years under all conditions of illumination and
phase, and have most carefully observed and mapped
and photographed its characteristic markings, are
agreed that there are evidences that changes are taking
place on the moon, and recently Prof. W. H. Pickering
has expressed the belief, substantiated by drawings,
that there is a progressive change of color or
darkening within certain lunar craters with the advance
of the lunar day, indicating, in his opinion, a rapid
vegetational growth that springs up in the height of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the lunar day and dies out as the lunar night approaches.</p>

<p>Some years ago certain selenographers suggested
that there might exist in the numberless crater-pits and
craters, in the deep-lying <i>maria</i> or "seas," and in the
clefts and rills and cracks that form intricate systems
all over the lunar surface, certain exhalations from the
surface and heavy vapors including possibly carbon
dioxide and water vapor to temper the extremes of the
long lunar days and night and furnish the necessary
medium for the support of certain forms of animal and
vegetable life.</p>

<p>Many astronomers, including a number who are not
in sympathy with the above view, believe that snow and
ice exist on the moon, even though water in the form
of liquid and vapor is not observable. All the extremely
brilliant portions of the surface, according to some
astronomers, are covered with snow and ice. Certainly,
some portions of the moon's surface reflect sunlight as
brilliantly as if they were covered with freshly fallen
snow, while other portions appear to be black by
contrast. There also appears to be evidence that certain
small markings, described as crater-cones and resembling
our terrestrial volcanoes more than any other
lunar feature, are at times temporarily obscured from
view by a veil of vapors. Many observers believe that
these crater-cones are active volcanic vents, and that
there is considerable volcanic activity still taking place
upon the moon.</p>

<p>These small crater-cones resemble, we are told, parasitic
cones found on the sides of terrestrial volcanoes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
and they are frequently seen on the floors of craters
closely associated with light streaks. These crater-cones
appear under a high sun as minute white spots
and can be studied to advantage only with powerful
instruments. The Italian astronomer, Maggini, observing
the floor of the lunar crater, Plato, in 1916 noted
that one of the small crater-cones that exist there in
great numbers, was temporarily obscured from view by
a cloud of reddish vapors, and Prof. W. H. Pickering,
at Arequipa, Peru, observing the same region some years
ago, believed that he saw evidence of change in some of
these small markings. The crater, Plato, has probably
been more carefully studied than any other portion of the
lunar surface. It is sixty miles in diameter and may be
seen even without a telescope as a dark "eye" not far
from the northern edge of the moon. Its floor is one
of the darkest objects in the moon&mdash;a dark steel-grey
in color&mdash;and there is no doubt that for some unknown
reason its dark hue deepens from the time the sun has
an altitude of twenty degrees until after full moon. It
has a brilliant white wall rising from 3,000 to 4,000
feet above its floor, crowned with several lofty peaks
and intersected by a number of valleys and passes.
The spots and faint light markings on the floor have
been the object of much study with small or moderate
sized instruments, and at least six of them are known
to be crater-cones. Since they can only be studied to
advantage with powerful instruments and as such instruments
are rarely used for a systematic study of
lunar markings, it is difficult to settle the controversy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
as to whether they have changed in appearance or have
been at any time obscured by vapors. Most lunar observing
is done&mdash;necessarily&mdash;with smaller instruments
because the majority of astronomers appear to have
accepted the view that the moon is a dead world, and
those who are engaged in astronomical work with our
greatest telescopes seem to feel that other fields of
research will prove more fruitful. Possibly it is for
this reason that we know so little about our nearest
neighbor in space! There are at least as many unsolved
problems confronting us on the moon as there are
among the distant stars.</p>

<p>Geologists tell us that more oxygen is to be found
in the first six feet of the earth's crust than in all
of the atmosphere above. Does oxygen not exist in
the surface rocks of the moon as well?</p>

<p>Volcanic action, we are told, is primarily an escape
of gases from the interior, chiefly hydrogen, nitrogen,
hydrocarbons, sulphur, and various compounds, as well
as vast quantities of steam. Beneath the surface chemical
change is continually taking place which results in
the release of an enormous amount of heat. Some
of the gases mentioned above combine with the oxygen
in the surface rocks and heat is evolved. It is a
known fact that there is great inherent heat in the
earth's surface crust. Why not in the moon's surface
crust as well?</p>

<p>The water that would be expelled in the form of
steam from volcanic vents on the moon would be
transformed immediately into hoar-frost, snow and ice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
and would settle down upon the flanks of the crater-cones
or vents.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that only volcanic activity
on an enormous scale would be plainly visible to us
even with the powerful telescopes at our command.
Ordinary eruptions such as occur on our own planet
would be very difficult to detect. Since the escaping
vapors would rapidly pass into the solid state and settle
down upon the flanks of the crater-cones or vents, we
would observe in general little if any change in an
object unless we chanced to be looking at it at the
time of the eruption, when it might appear to be
temporarily obscured by a veil of vapors. What are
the chances that we would be carefully observing at the
precise time of an eruption, a minute marking, two or
three miles in diameter, on a surface as large as all
of North America, a surface that is covered with some
30,000 charted craters, numberless crater-pits, streaks,
rays, spots, clefts and rills in intricate systems, mountain
chains and valleys and a mass of intricate detail?</p>

<p>If we were looking at the earth from the moon with
the aid of a powerful telescope would we be apt to
notice an eruption of Vesuvius or Katmai or Mauna
Loa? Objects four or five miles in diameter would
appear as hazy spots with nothing distinctive or remarkable
in their appearance. Yet vapor and steam arising
from terrestrial volcanoes would be carried by our
atmosphere over an area of many square miles, while
there is no atmosphere on the moon to spread the vapors
that may arise from similar volcanic vents. It would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
have to be a cataclysmic change indeed to be accepted
as indisputable evidence that change is taking place
on the moon, and the days of gigantic upheavals are
probably over on our satellite as well as on the earth.
If volcanic activity is still taking place on the moon it
is probably in a mild form such as a comparatively
quiet emission of gases from volcanic vents and fumaroles.
Such forms of activity would not be plainly
visible at this distance, even with the aid of powerful
telescopes. The problem of detecting changes on the
moon is complicated by the fact that a change of illumination
greatly alters the appearance of all lunar
markings. Such a change is continually taking place
in the course of the month. A marking that stands out
in bold relief at lunar sunrise or sunset will change
entirely in appearance a few days later under a high
sun or even disappear from view entirely. These
changes in phase or illumination have to be taken account
of in the search for evidence of actual change.
To decide whether or not change has actually taken
place the object must be viewed under similar conditions,
so far as they can be obtained. Even when
special care is taken in this respect the suspected evidence
of change is usually "explained away" as due
to differences in illumination or seeing, by those who
have not observed the object themselves and are not
in sympathy with the view that the moon is anything
but a dead world.</p>

<p>As regards the question of life on the moon, it is
interesting to consider the facts brought out by investigations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
made by scientists connected with the Geophysical
Laboratory of the Carnegie Institute in the
Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes. The volcanic activity
there takes the form of eruptions from numerous
small vents or fumaroles and ninety-nine per cent. of
the emanations are water vapor. It was observed that
blue-green algae were living at the edge of active vents
emitting ammonia compounds at a temperature of
212° F. They were not found, however, near vents
from which ammonia compounds were not being
emitted. If life exists under such conditions it is conceivable
that suitable conditions for the support of
certain forms of life, animal as well as vegetable, may
be found in low-lying valleys and crevices and upon
the floors of craters, where certain gases essential to the
support of life might be evolved from many small volcanic
vents and fumaroles.</p>

<p>Many theories have been advanced to explain the
origin of the lunar craters which have no counterpart
on our own planet. They are saucer-like depressions
in the surface of the moon, frequently of such great
size that an observer standing in the center would not
be able to see either side of the crater owing to the
curvature of the moon's surface. Craters fifty, sixty
or one hundred miles in diameter are by no means
uncommon, while there are thousands between five and
fifty miles in diameter. A characteristic feature of
many craters is a central peak, and the surrounding
walls are often a mile or more high and in some
instances are symmetrically terraced. New craters
have been formed on the sides or floors of old craters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and these are always more clear-cut and sharper in outlines
than the old formations, and generally much
smaller. A number of craters are surrounded by a system
of light streaks or rays of unknown origin that extend
in some instances to enormous distances on all sides of
the crater. The most conspicuous system is the one
surrounding the lunar crater Tycho near the south
pole of the moon. The rays originating in this crater
extend in all directions for hundreds of miles without
turning aside for any obstructions, passing over mountains,
craters and plains in their course in practically
straight lines like spokes in a wheel. This ray system
of Tycho is the most noticeable marking on the moon's
surface at the time of full moon. As these streaks
cast no shadow they are apparently cracks in the surface
that have filled up with some light-colored material
from below. Their origin has never been satisfactorily
explained.</p>

<p>As to the origin of the lunar craters, some believe
that they were produced in past ages by a bombardment
of the lunar surface by huge meteoric masses; but there
are many objections to this theory that we will not
take up here. It is more generally believed that the
lunar craters are a result of volcanic activity on an
enormous scale which took place on the moon many
ages ago and which has now practically ceased, its only
manifestations now taking the form of a quiet emission
of gases from small volcanic vents or fumaroles
which exist all over the lunar surface but which are
to be found in greatest numbers on the floors and sides
of craters.</p>

<h2><a name="XXII" id="XXII">XXII</a><br /><br />

COMETS</h2>


<p>The orbits of comets are inclined at all angles to
each other and to the orbits of the planets which,
on the other hand, lie very nearly in the same plane.</p>

<p>The larger members of the sun's family, the planets
and their satellites, revolve from west to east around
the sun. Comets on the contrary frequently retrograde
or back around the sun in the opposite direction&mdash;from
east to west.</p>

<p>The paths that these erratic visitors follow in their
journeys around the sun bear not the slightest resemblance
to the paths of the planets, which are almost
perfect circles. The orbits of comets are ellipses that
are greatly elongated or parabolas. If the orbit is a
parabola the comet makes one and only one visit to
the sun, coming from interstellar space and returning
thereto after a brief sojourn within our solar system.</p>

<p>Donati's comet of 1858, one of the greatest comets
of the nineteenth century, had a period of more than
two thousand years and its aphelion (the point in its
orbit farthest away from the sun) was five times more
distant than the orbit of Neptune.</p>

<p>There is, however, a class of comets known as
<i>periodic</i> comets that have extremely short periods of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
revolution around the sun. To this class belongs
Halley's comet whose period of seventy-five years
exceeds that of any other short period comet. Encke's
comet, on the other hand, has a period of three and a
third years which is the shortest cometary period known.
Most of the periodic comets are inconspicuous and
only visible telescopically even when comparatively
near to the earth. Halley's comet is the only one of
this class that lays any pretensions to remarkable size
or brilliancy and it also is showing the effects of disintegration
resulting from too frequent visits to the sun.</p>

<p>Comets are bodies of great bulk or volume and small
total mass. Their tails, which only develop in the
vicinity of the sun, are formed of the rarest gases, and
the best vacuum that man can produce would not be
in as tenuous a state as the material existing in the tails
of comets. There are many proofs of the extreme
tenuity of comets. The earth has on a number of
occasions passed directly through the tails of comets
without experiencing the slightest visible effects. Stars
shine undimmed in luster even through the heads of
comets. If the earth should encounter a comet "head
on" it is doubtful if it would experience anything more
serious than a shower of meteors which would be consumed
by friction with the earth's atmosphere, or a fall
of meteorites over a small area of a few square miles.
It is possible, however, that matter in the nucleus, the
star-like condensation in the head of a comet, may consist
of individual particles weighing in some instances
a number of tons, surrounded by a gaseous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
envelope and held together by the loose bonds of
their mutual attraction. If the earth should encounter
the nucleus of a comet considerable damage might be
done over a portion of the earth's surface, but the
chances of such an occurrence are less than one in a
million.</p>

<p>Since the total mass of a comet is so small, a close
approach to one of the planets, especially Jupiter, produces
great changes in the form of the comet's orbit,
though the motion of the planet is not disturbed in the
slightest degree by the encounter.</p>

<p>The majority of all the short-period comets have been
"captured" by Jupiter, that is, the original orbits have
been so changed by the perturbations produced by close
approaches to the giant planet that their aphelia, or the
points in their orbits farthest from the sun, lie in the
vicinity of Jupiter's orbit. Several of the other planets
have also "captured" comets in this sense, and the fact
that the aphelia of a number of comets are grouped at
certain definite intervals beyond the orbit of Neptune
has been considered by some astronomers to be an indication
that there are two or more additional planets
in the solar system revolving around the sun at these
distances.</p>

<p>The most interesting feature of a comet is its characteristic
tail which develops and increases in size and
brilliancy as the comet approaches the sun. As the tail
is always turned away from the sun it follows the
comet as it draws near the sun and precedes it as it
departs. Its origin is due, it is believed, both to electrical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
repulsion and light-pressure acting upon minute
particles of matter in the coma or head of the comet.</p>

<p>The curvature of the tail depends upon the nature of
the gases of which it is composed. Long, straight tails
consist chiefly of hydrogen, it has been found, curved
tails of hydrocarbons and short, bushy tails of mixtures
of iron, sodium and other metallic vapors. At times
the same comet will have two or more tails of different
types.</p>

<p>Since the material driven off from the nucleus or
head of a comet by electrical repulsion and light-pressure
is never recovered, it is evident that comets are
continually disintegrating. Also, comets that have
passed close to the sun at perihelion have frequently
been so disrupted by tidal forces that one nucleus has
separated into several parts and the newly formed
nuclei have pursued paths parallel to the original orbit,
each nucleus developing a tail of its own.</p>

<p>Many periodic comets, it is now known, have gradually
been broken up and dissipated into periodic swarms
of meteors as a result of the disruptive effect produced
by too frequent returns to the vicinity of the sun.</p>

<p>These swarms of meteors continue to travel around
the sun in the orbits of the former comets. The earth
encounters a number of such swarms every year at
certain definite times.</p>

<p>The largest and best known of these swarms or
showers are the Leonids, which appear about November
15; the Andromedas (or Bielids), which appear later in
the same month and the Perseids, which appear early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
in August. These swarms are named for the constellations
in which their "radiant" lies, that is, the point in
the heavens from which they appear to radiate. The
position of the radiant depends upon the direction
from which the swarm is coming. It is simply a
matter of perspective that the individual particles appear
to radiate from the one point, for they are actually
travelling in parallel lines.</p>

<p>The luminosity of these meteoric particles is caused
by the friction produced by their passage through the
atmosphere. They always appear noiselessly because
they are mere particles of meteoric dust weighing at the
most scarcely a grain. They differ greatly in this
respect from their large and noisy relatives, the meteorites,
bolides and fireballs.</p>

<p>Numberless small meteoric particles are entrapped
by the earth's atmosphere every day. They are referred
to as "shooting" stars or "falling" stars though,
of course, they are not in any sense stars. It is only
when these meteoric particles travel in well-defined
cometary orbits and appear at certain definite times
every year that they are referred to as swarms or
showers of meteors.</p>

<p>The luminosity of comets is due not only to reflected
sunlight, but to certain unknown causes that produce
sudden and erratic increases or decreases of brilliancy.
The causes of these sudden changes in luminosity are
unknown; possibly electrical discharges or chance collisions
between fragments of considerable size may account
for some of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>The peculiar behavior of the tails of comets at certain
times has frequently been noted and suggests the
existence of quantities of finely-divided meteoric or
gaseous matter within the solar system that has no
appreciable effect upon the huge planetary masses, but
offers sensible resistance to the passage of the tenuous
gases of which the tails of comets are composed. The
fact that the earth daily encounters meteoric dust,
meteorites and fireballs also indicates that meteoric
matter exists in considerable quantities within our
solar system. Tails of comets appear at times to be
twisted or brushed aside as if they had encountered
some unknown force or some resisting medium.</p>

<p>Up to the present time several hundred comets have
been discovered. Nearly three-fourths of this number
travel in orbits that appear to be parabolas. Of the
remaining number there are about forty that have
been "captured" by the major planets, Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus and Neptune, though Jupiter possesses the
lion's share of these captured comets. Scarcely a year
passes by that several comets are not discovered. Most
of these are telescopic, however, even when they are
near the sun and at their greatest brilliancy. Naked-eye
comets of great splendor and brilliancy are comparatively
rare and there has been a particular dearth
of such unusual comets during the past thirty years
or so.</p>

<p>The last spectacular comet, unless we make an exception
of Halley's periodic comet, which made its return
according to prediction in 1910, was the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
comet of 1882 which was visible in broad daylight
close to the sun and at its perihelion passage swept
through the solar corona with a velocity that exceeded
two hundred and fifty miles a second and carried it
through one hundred and eighty degrees of its orbit
in less than three hours.</p>

<p>Some comets approach much closer to the sun than
others. The majority of all comets observed have
come within the earth's orbit and no known comet
has its perihelion beyond the orbit of Jupiter. It
is, of course, possible that there may be a number of
comets that never come within the orbit of Jupiter,
but it is very unlikely that any such comet would ever
be discovered. The majority of comets are simply
small, fuzzy points of light that are only visible telescopically
and the greater the perihelion distance of the
comet the less likely is it to be seen with the naked eye.</p>

<p>Since comets as well as planets obey Kepler's first
law, known as the law of areas, and sweep over equal
areas in equal times, it is evident that when a comet is
at perihelion, or nearest to the sun, it is moving at maximum
speed and when it is at aphelion, or farthest from
the sun, it is moving at minimum speed. Moreover,
its speed at these two points in its orbit varies tremendously
since the orbits of comets are ellipses of
very high eccentricity. The speed with which the planets
are traveling is, on the other hand, remarkably
uniform since their orbits are nearly circular.</p>

<p>The leisurely speed with which a comet travels
through the frigid outer regions of the solar system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
is gradually accelerated as the comet draws nearer and
nearer to the sun until it has acquired near the time of
perihelion passage a velocity that occasionally exceeds
two hundred miles a second. Here, also, the great increase
in light and heat and the strong magnetic field of
the sun produce complex changes in the gaseous and
meteoric substances of which the comet is composed
until the characteristic tail and peculiar cometary features
are fully developed. As the comet again recedes
from the sun after perihelion passage its speed slackens
once more. It soon parts with its tail and other spectacular
features and fades rapidly from view even in
the largest telescopes.</p>

<h2><a name="XXIII" id="XXIII">XXIII</a><br /><br />

METEORITES</h2>


<p>Meteorites, bolides or fireballs, as they are variously
called, are stones that fall to the earth from
the heavens. They furnish the one tangible evidence
that we possess, aside from that furnished by the spectroscope,
as to the composition of other bodies in space
and it is a significant fact that no unknown elements
have ever been found in meteorites, though the forms
in which they appear are so characteristic that they
make these stones readily distinguishable from stones
of terrestrial origin.</p>

<p>The origin of meteorites is not definitely known, but
the evidence is very strong in favor of the theory that
they are the larger fragments of disintegrated comets
of which meteors and shooting stars are the smaller;
the distinction between the two being simply that the
latter class includes all bodies that are completely consumed
by friction with the earth's atmosphere and,
therefore, only reach the surface in the form of meteoric
dust.</p>

<p>According to other theories meteorites may be fragments
of shattered worlds that have chanced to come
too near to a larger body and have been disrupted, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
they may possibly be the larger fragments of the disintegrated
comets of which the meteoric swarms are
the smaller.</p>

<p>Interplanetary space is not altogether a void. Our
own planet sweeps up in the course of a single day, it
has been estimated, approximately twenty million shooting stars
or meteors of sufficient size to be visible to
the naked eye, while the estimate for the telescopic particles
runs up to four hundred million.</p>

<p>Meteorites on the other hand are comparatively rare.
On the average it has been estimated about one hundred
meteorites strike the earth in the course of a year,
of which number only two or three are actually seen.
According to <cite>Bulletin 94, U. S. National Museum</cite>, approximately
six hundred and fifty falls and finds of
meteorites have been reported, representatives of which
appear in museums and private collections.</p>

<p>Meteorites, as well as shooting stars and meteors,
frequently appear in showers. In such instances the
fall usually consists of several hundred or thousand individual
stones and the area over which they fall is
several square miles in extent and roughly ellipsoidal
in shape. One of the most remarkable of such <a name="dupl" id="dupl">falls</a> <ins title="Note: duplicate line deleted. Possible missing text in original.">[...]</ins>
hundred thousand stones, varying in weight from fifteen
pounds to a small fraction of an ounce, fell near Pultusk,
Poland. Another remarkable fall of meteorites
occurred at L'Aigle, France, in 1803. Between two
thousand and three thousand stones fell over an ellipsoidal
area of six and two-tenths miles in greatest diameter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the aggregate weight of the stones being not less
than seventy-five pounds.</p>

<p>This fall of stones is of particular interest since it
took place at a time when men were still very doubtful
as to whether or not stones actually fell to earth from
the heavens.</p>

<p>After this fall had occurred in a most populous district
of France in broad daylight and attended by violent
explosions that lasted for five or six minutes and were
heard for a distance of seventy-five miles, no reasonable
doubt could longer be held as to the actuality of
such phenomena.</p>

<p>Meteorites are without exception of an igneous nature,
that is, they are rocks that have solidified from a
molten condition. They can be classified into three
groups, Aerolites or Stony Meteorites, Siderolites or
Stony-iron Meteorites, and Siderites or Iron Meteorites.</p>

<p>More iron meteorites seem to have fallen in Mexico
and Greenland than in any other part of the world&mdash;at
least of its land surface.</p>

<p>Yet strange to say, of all the meteorites that have been
seen to fall only nine belong to the group of Siderites
or Iron Meteorites, though the three largest meteorites
known, Peary's meteorite from Cape York, Greenland,
weighing 37&frac12; tons, the meteorite lying on the plain
near Bacubirito, Mexico, weighing about 20 tons, and
the Willamette, Oregon, meteorite, weighing 15&frac12; tons
all belong to this group. Moreover, all the Canyon
Diablo meteorites, which are strewn concentrically
around Coon Mountain crater in northern Arizona to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
distance of about five miles, are members of this same
group. Coon Mountain or Meteor crater itself is a
perfectly round hole, about six hundred feet deep and
over four thousand feet in diameter and was formed,
it is believed, by the impact of a huge meteorite which
has never been found. It is believed that the Canyon
Diablo meteorites, of which there are nearly four hundred
individuals in the U. S. National Museum alone,
were all members of this same fall. It is possible that
these meteorites of the Canyon Diablo district, with
the huge meteorite that produced the crater itself, formed
the nucleus of a comet that struck the earth not more
than five thousand years ago, according to the geological
evidence.</p>

<p>All iron meteorites or siderites (from the Greek
sideros, iron) are composed chiefly of alloys of nickel
and iron. The percentage of nickel in these iron meteorites
is very small, usually from five to ten per cent.,
while the iron forms about ninety or ninety-five per
cent. of the whole. Cobalt is also present in practically
all iron meteorites in small quantities of 1 per cent.
or less. Usually small quantities of iron sulphide and
phosphide as well as graphite or some other form of
carbon appear in the iron meteorites and in some instances
black and white diamonds have been found, as
in some of the Canyon Diablo irons.</p>

<p>A very interesting and beautiful feature of many
iron meteorites is the Widmanstätten figures which appear
when a section of such a stone is polished and
treated by means of a weak acid. These figures are due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
to the unequal solubility of the three different alloys of
nickel and iron of which the stones are composed.
The irons giving the Widmanstätten figures are known
as octahedral irons. Other irons known as hexahedral
irons give figures of a different type known as Neumann
figures when the polished section is treated with weak
acid, while other irons are so homogeneous in their
composition that they show no figures at all.</p>

<p>Aerolites or Stony Meteorites occur more abundantly
than iron or stony-iron types, and they are classified
into many divisions and subdivisions according to their
composition. In these stones appear certain compounds
that are commonly met with in terrestrial igneous
rocks. The mineral that is most abundant in the stony
meteorites, composing sometimes nearly seventy-five
per cent. of the stone, is a magnesium and iron silicate
known as olivine, which is also usually present in terrestrial
rocks of an igneous nature. Certain compounds
found in the stony meteorites are rarely if ever found
in terrestrial rocks, however, and these serve to distinguish
the stony meteorites readily from stones of
terrestrial origin. The alloys of iron and nickel, for
instance, that occur in minor quantities in the stony
meteorites and make up usually about ninety-five per
cent. of the mass of the iron meteorites, are never found
in terrestrial rocks. Although about thirty of the terrestrial
elements are to be found in meteorites, the
forms and compounds in which they appear are so characteristic
and on the whole so different from those
occurring in terrestrial rocks, that the analyst has no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
difficulty in distinguishing between the two. There are,
for instance certain formations known as chondrules,
peculiar spherical and oval shapes, varying in size from
minute particles to objects the size of walnuts, appearing
in many varieties of stony meteorites that are never
found in terrestrial rocks, and that are one of the most
puzzling features associated with the origin and nature
of these stones. Sometimes the chondrules are so
loosely embedded in the stone that they fall away when
it is broken. In some instances almost the entire stone
is made up of these chondrules. According to one
theory the chondrules were originally molten drops,
like fiery rain, and their internal structure, which
is greatly varied, depends upon their conditions of
cooling.</p>

<p>Stony meteorites, in which these chondrules are to
be found, are spoken of as chondrites. There are
white and gray and black chondrites and crystalline and
carbonaceous chondrites, according to the nature of the
chondrules found in the stones.</p>

<p>Stony meteorites also contain minute quantities of
iron and nickel alloys in the form of drops or stringers.</p>

<p>Upon entering the earth's atmosphere stony meteorites
become coated with a thin black crust which is
a glass formed by the fusion of its surface materials
by the heat generated during its passage through the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>In many of the stony meteorites there also appear
fine thread-like veins which are due to the fracturing
of the stone prior to its entrance into the atmosphere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
The material filling these veins is coal black in color,
opaque and of an unknown composition.</p>

<p>Many meteorites show signs of collisions and encounters
with other meteorites outside of the atmosphere
as would be expected as they travel in swarms
and groups. Sometimes the entire meteorite is composed
of fragments of two or more distinct stones
cemented together. Such a stone is spoken of as a
<i>breccia</i>.</p>

<p>In the third class of meteorites to which we now
come, known as the stony-iron meteorites, there is a
network or sponge of nickel-iron alloy, the interstices
of which are filled with stony material.</p>

<p>When this network or sponge is continuous the
meteorite is spoken of as a stony-iron pallasite. When
the network of metal is more or less disconnected the
meteorite is a meso-siderite.</p>

<p>If meteorites are heated in a vacuum, the conditions
existing in interplanetary space being thus produced
to a certain extent, they give forth their occluded gases
and it has been found that these gases give spectra
identical with the spectra of certain comets. Meteoric
irons give forth hydrogen as their characteristic gas
while the gases occluded in the stony meteorites are
chiefly the oxides of carbon, carbon monoxide and carbon
dioxide. It has been found that the amount of
gases contained in a large meteorite or shower of
meteorites is sufficient to form the tail of a comet.
These facts all tend to strengthen the belief that meteorites
are indeed cometary fragments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>In view of the fact that some geologists believe meteorites
may be fragments of other worlds, it is of
interest to know that so far no fossil-bearing meteorites
have been found, and if meteorites are fragments of a
shattered world, such worlds must have been reduced
to a molten condition at the time of the catastrophe.</p>

<p>The rapid passage of the meteorite through the air
leaves a partial vacuum in its trail into which rush the
molecules of air from all sides, producing the characteristic
noises that accompany the passage of a meteorite,
which have been variously compared to the rattle of
artillery, the distant booming of cannons or the rumble
of thunder.</p>

<p>There may be, also, explosions of inflammable gases
occluded in the crevices of the meteorite which will
shatter it into fragments or the meteorite may be shattered
by the resistance and pressure of the atmosphere
or as a result of the extremes of temperature existing
between the interior and its surface. Many meteorites
have actually been seen to burst into fragments in the
air with a loud report.</p>

<p>There is practically no foundation for the belief that
germs of life have been brought to our planet on such
igneous rocks. No microscopic examinations of meteorites
have yielded any results that could be interpreted
in favor of such a view.</p>

<p>Falls of meteorites are accompanied in nearly every
instance by terrific explosions and sharp reports that
can be heard for many miles around, often causing the
ground to shake as in an earthquake. The meteorite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
itself has been described as resembling a ball of fire
or the headlight of a locomotive, and is followed frequently
by a trail of light or a cloud of smoke. At
the time it enters our atmosphere a meteorite is moving
with planetary velocity ranging from two to forty-five
miles per second. Its interior is intensely cold, approaching
in temperature the absolute zero of interplanetary
space, and it is, therefore, far more brittle
than it would be at ordinary temperatures. As it
ploughs its way into the earth's atmosphere its surface
temperature is soon raised by friction to at least 3,000°
or 4,000° C., which is sufficient to fuse all surface
materials into the characteristic black crust, with which
stony meteorites are coated.</p>

<p>Meteorites are usually first seen at an altitude of fifty
or sixty miles. Although they are moving with a velocity
comparable to that of the planets, when they enter the
earth's atmosphere, this velocity is so rapidly reduced
by friction with the atmosphere that they usually drop
to the surface of the earth with a velocity about equal
to that of ordinary falling objects.</p>

<p>The flight of a meteorite often extends over a path
several hundred miles in length and the meteorite may
be seen by many observers in several different States
and yet finally fall in some unknown spot and never be
found.</p>

<p>The evidence gathered regarding the actual fall of
meteorites is often contradictory. Some stones are
too hot to handle for hours after they fall, others are
merely warm, while still others have been picked up cool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
or even intensely cold. Meteorites have been seen to
fall upon dried grass and upon straw without producing
even charring effects. The evidence regarding the
depths to which meteorites penetrate the ground is
quite as conflicting. The largest of all the stony meteorites
which fell at Krnyahinya, Hungary, weighed
647 pounds and buried itself to a depth of eleven feet.
Yet Peary's Cape York iron meteorite, weighing 37&frac12;
tons, was only partially covered and showed no signs
of abrasions of surface resulting from the fall.</p>

<p>The Willamette iron meteorite, weighing 16&frac12; tons,
lay in a forest when found and was not deeply buried.
The Bacubirito iron meteorite, weighing 20 tons, lay in
soft soil, barely beneath the level of the surface. On
the other hand a fragment of a stony-iron meteorite,
weighing 437 pounds, that fell at Estherville, Iowa,
buried itself eight feet in stiff clay.</p>

<p>Geologists in charge of the meteoric collections of
various museums quite frequently have stones sent to
them for analysis that are reputed to be of celestial
origin. More often than not such stones are found
to be purely terrestrial in their origin. The composition
of a meteorite is so characteristic and unique that
such a stone can never be mistaken. Finds of bona-fide
meteorites are on the whole extremely rare.</p>

<p>It is also a peculiar fact that meteorites are usually
observed in the months when ordinary meteors or
periodic swarms of meteors are least prevalent, that is
in the months of May, June and July.</p>

<h2><a name="XXIV" id="XXIV">XXIV</a><br /><br />

THE EARTH AS A MAGNET</h2>


<p>If a small, freely suspended compass needle is moved
over a highly magnetized steel sphere, it will be seen
that it constantly changes its position both horizontally
and vertically so as to lie always along the "lines of
force" of the sphere.</p>

<p>There will be one point on the sphere which we will
call the <i>North Magnetic Pole</i>, where the <em>north-seeking</em>
end of the needle will point vertically downward or
make a "dip" of 90° with the tangent plane. At the
diametrically opposite point on the sphere, called the
South Magnetic Pole, the opposite end of the compass,
the south-seeking end, will point vertically downward;
while at a point midway between the magnetic poles
of the sphere the needle will lie parallel to the diameter
connecting the two poles and there will be no dip.</p>

<p>The total intensity of the magnetic field surrounding
the sphere will be found to be greatest in the vicinity
of the magnetic poles and least, midway between the
poles.</p>

<p>Now, a freely suspended compass needle carried to
all parts of the earth will behave very much in the
same manner as the needle moved over the magnetized
steel sphere. There are two points on the earth's surface,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
known as the North and South Magnetic Poles, where
the needle points vertically downward and approximately
midway between is the <i>Magnetic Equator</i> where the
compass needle places itself in a perfectly horizontal
position and the "dip" of the needle is zero. In other
words, the earth acts as a huge magnet and possesses
a magnetic field with lines of force converging towards
its poles similar to the lines of force of the steel sphere.</p>

<p>There are, however, some very important differences
between the sphere of steel and our earth. The matter
of which the earth is composed is not homogeneous.
It is believed to possess an iron core of considerable
size, it is true, but its outer shell is composed of heterogeneous
masses that in certain regions cause very appreciable
local deflections of the needle. It is surrounded,
moreover, by an atmosphere permeated by
electrified particles of matter shot forth from the sun,
which we now know is a still greater magnet surrounded
by a magnetic field that is of the order of 50 gausses at
the poles and about eighty times more powerful than
that of the earth.</p>

<p>It is now a well-established fact that the sun's magnetic
field exerts a powerful influence over the condition
of the earth's magnetic field, and that vast solar
disturbances affect very materially the direction and intensity
of the lines of force.</p>

<p>It is thus little wonder that this non-homogeneous and
rapidly rotating terrestrial globe, surrounded by an
electrified atmosphere and subject to the action of a still
more powerful magnet, the sun, should not behave in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
manner exactly analogous to a uniformly magnetized
steel sphere.</p>

<p>The earth's magnetic poles are neither symmetrically
placed nor absolutely fixed in position. There is every
reason to suspect that they shift about from year to
year, and possibly fluctuate irregularly in position in
the course of a few days or hours under the influence
of disturbing forces. The position of the earth's North
Magnetic Pole, last visited by Amundsen in 1903, now
lies approximately in Latitude 70° N. Longitude 97°
W. The position of the South Magnetic Pole, according
to the latest determinations, is, in round numbers, in
Latitude 73° S. and Longitude 156° E. of Greenwich.
It is evident, therefore, that the magnetic poles of the
earth are not symmetrically placed and that they lie
fully 30° from the <em>geographical</em> poles. The chord connecting
the magnetic poles passes 750 miles from the
earth's center, and it is about 1,200 miles from the geographic
pole to the nearest magnetic pole. There
exist, moreover, in high latitudes local magnetic poles,
due possibly to heavy local deposits of ore. One such
pole was discovered at Cape Treadwell, near Juneau,
Alaska, during Dr. L. A. Bauer's observations there in
1900 and 1907. In the center of the observing tent
at this point the needle pointed vertically downward and
the compass <em>reversed</em> its direction when carried from
one side of the tent to the other.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that there are very few points
on the earth's surface where the compass needle points
either to the true geographical pole or to the magnetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
pole, and if it does chance to do so, it is a transient
happening. The "variation of the compass" or the declination
of the needle, as it is called, is the angle that
the compass needle makes with the true north and south
line or the meridian. It is an angle of greatest importance
to navigators and explorers, for it gives them
their bearings, yet it is unfortunately subject to ceaseless
variations of a most complicated nature, since it depends
on the constantly pulsating and never ceasing
magnetic changes that sweep over the surface of the
earth and through its crust. It is affected by long
period or secular changes, as they are called, progressing
more or less regularly in obscure cycles of unknown
period. It is subject to a diurnal change that depends
on the position of the sun relative to the meridian, and
that varies with the seasons and with the hour of the
day. It is affected by the sun spot cycle of 11.3 years
which has a direct effect upon the intensity of the earth's
magnetic field. The intensity of the magnetic field in
sun spots is, according to Abbot, sometimes as high as
4,500 gausses or 9,000 times the intensity of the earth's
field. At times of maximum spottedness of the sun the
intensity of the earth's magnetic field is reduced.</p>

<p>Moreover, when great and rapidly changing spots
appear upon the sun, electrified particles are shot forth
from the sun with great velocity and in great numbers,
and are drawn in towards the magnetic poles of the
earth. Meeting the rarefied gases of the earth's upper
atmosphere, they illuminate them as electric discharges
illuminate a vacuum tube. Some of these electrons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
are absorbed by gases at high elevations, other descend
to lower levels. The most penetrating rays have
been known to descend to an altitude of twenty-five
miles which is about the lowest limit yet found for
auroral displays. It is the passage of these rays through
the atmosphere that cause the magnetic disturbances
known as <i>magnetic storms</i>, that are associated with
the appearance of great sun spots and auroral displays.
At such times sudden changes take place in the intensity
of the earth's magnetic field that cause the compass
needle to shiver and tremble and temporarily lose its
directive value. These <i>magnetic storms</i> have been
known to produce great temporal changes in the intensity
of the earth's field. According to Dr. L. A.
Bauer, Director of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism
of the Carnegie Institute of Washington, the
earth's intensity of magnetization was altered by about
one-twentieth or one-thirtieth part by the magnetic
storm of September 25, 1909, which was one of the
most remarkable on record, and the earth's magnetic
condition was below par for fully three months afterwards
as a result.</p>

<p>In addition to these various regular and irregular
changes in the variation of the compass, or declination
of the needle, due to changes in the earth's magnetic
field <em>as a whole</em>, there are local effects due to restricted
regional disturbances of the earth's magnetic field or
to local deposits of ore, or to volcanoes or other local
causes. The effect of all these disturbances upon the
declination of the needle must be determined by continual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
magnetic surveys of all portions of the earth's
surface.</p>

<p>As a whole the earth's magnetic field is more uniform
over the oceans than over the land, with all its disturbing
topographical features. Yet this advantage is offset
largely in navigation by the fact that every steel ship
that sails the seas is a <em>magnet</em>, with its two magnetic
poles and its neutral line where the two opposite magnetic
forces are neutralized, as is the case with every
magnet. The direction in which a steel ship lies with
reference to the earth's magnetic field while it is being
built determines the position of the magnetic poles in its
hull and the position of its neutral line and this distribution
of magnetism over a ship's hull must be taken
account of in the installation of its standard compass.
Every piece of horizontal and vertical iron aboard ship
has an effect upon the variation of the compass and
compensation must be made for such disturbing forces.
The direction of sailing, the position in which a ship
lies at dock, storms encountered at sea, the firing of
batteries (on warships) are some of the factors that are
operative in producing changes in the variation of the
magnetic compass aboard a ship.</p>

<p>Every ship must undergo at frequent intervals magnetic
surveys for the purpose of determining its magnetic
constants and its "Table of Deviations of the
Compass."</p>

<p>The direction in which the compass needle points
aboard ship is the <i>resultant</i> of the effect of the earth's
magnetic field and the magnetic field of the ship, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
both fields are subject to continual and complicated
variations from year to year, from day to day, <em>and
even from hour to hour</em>!</p>

<p>The elements of the earth's magnetic field are determined
for any one epoch by long-continued magnetic
surveys carried on to a greater or less extent by the
various nations of the world, and the results are published
in the form of <i>magnetic charts</i> for land and sea,
showing the values of the three magnetic elements, declination
of the needle, dip or inclination, and horizontal
intensity of the earth's field for a definite period. So
rapid are even the long-period changes in the earth's
magnetic field that a magnetic chart can be relied upon
for only a very few years and fresh data for the construction
of these charts that are so valuable to navigators
and explorers must be gathered continually.</p>

<p>The <i>Department of Terrestrial Magnetism</i> of the
Carnegie Institute of Washington is engaged in continual
magnetic surveys of the earth by land and sea
that are of the highest value not only to navigators but
also to scientists interested in solving the great and
mysterious problem of the underlying causes of the
earth's magnetism.</p>

<p>To give an idea of the extent and scope of the work
of this department it may be mentioned that its non-magnetic
ship <i>Carnegie</i> made in the period 1909-1918
a total run of 189,176 nautical miles, nearly nine times
the earth's circumference, with an average day's run of
119 nautical miles. Magnetic observations were made
practically every day at a distance of 100 to 150 miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
apart. In this nine-year period five cruises were made.
On her first cruise the <i>Carnegie</i> sailed from St. John's,
Newfoundland, to Falmouth, England, over practically
the same course followed by the famous astronomer,
Halley, in the <i>Paramour Pink</i> two centuries earlier to
determine the variation of the compass. In her fourth
voyage the <i>Carnegie</i> circumnavigated the world in sub-antarctic
regions in 118 days&mdash;a record time. She
has traversed all oceans from 80° North to the parallel
of 60° South and has crossed and recrossed her own
path and the path of her predecessor, the <i>Galilee</i>, many
times, thus making it possible to determine for the
points of intersection the secular changes in the magnetic
elements.</p>

<p>After a thorough overhauling in 1919 and the installation
of a four-cylinder gasoline engine, <em>made of
bronze</em> throughout, to take the place of the producer-gas
engine used on earlier cruises, the <i>Carnegie</i> started
on her sixth cruise with a crew of twenty-three officers
and men on October 9, 1919. A cruise of 61,500 miles
was planned in the South Atlantic, Indian and Pacific
Oceans to last approximately two years. Unsurveyed
regions in the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean were to
be covered and the route was planned so as to obtain
a large number of observations of the progressive
changes that have taken place in the magnetic elements.
This is accomplished as stated above by intersecting
former routes and obtaining new values of the element
at the points of intersection.</p>

<p>In addition to its ocean magnetic surveys the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
<i>Department of Terrestrial Magnetism</i> also carries on extensive
land surveys in all parts of the globe. In 1919
special expeditions were sent out by the Department to
observe the total solar eclipse of May 29th at stations
distributed over the entire zone of visibility of the
eclipse and immediately outside. At Dr. Bauer's station
in Liberia the total phase was visible in a cloudless
sky for more than six minutes, which is very close to
the maximum length of phase that can possibly be observed.
Unmistakable evidence was gathered at all
stations of an appreciable variation in the earth's magnetic
field during a solar eclipse, which variation is
the reverse of that causing the daylight portion of the
solar diurnal variation of the needle.</p>

<p>In addition to the magnetic survey work on land and
sea which is the chief work of the <i>Department of Terrestrial
Magnetism</i>, atmospheric-electric observations are
carried on continually on land and sea and experiments
have been carried on at Langley Field, Va., lately, in
the development of methods and instruments for determining
the geographical position of airplanes by astronomical
observations. There has also been recently
formed under this department a <i>Section of Terrestrial
Electricity</i>.</p>

<p>The cause of the earth's magnetic field is still one of
the greatest unsolved problems of astro-physics. The
theory that has been advanced by Schuster that all large
rotating masses are magnets <em>as a result of their rotation</em>
has received considerable attention from astrophysicists,
and attempts have been made to prove this experimentally.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
It has been found that iron globes spun
at high velocities in the laboratory do <em>not</em> exhibit magnetic
properties. This may mean simply that the magnetic
field is too weak to be detected in the case of a
comparatively small iron sphere spun for a limited
period under laboratory conditions. It must be remembered
that the earth has been rotating rapidly on its axis
for millions of years and is, compared to terrestrial
objects, an extremely large mass. Yet it has been shown
that as a whole our earth is an extremely weak magnet,
and that if it were made entirely of steel and magnetized
as highly as an ordinary steel-bar magnet,
the magnetic forces at its surface would be a thousand
times greater than they actually are.</p>

<p>If it is true that all rotating bodies are magnets,
then all the heavenly bodies, planets, suns and nebulæ
are surrounded by magnetic fields. We know nothing
to the contrary. In fact, we know this to be true for
the earth and sun, and strongly suspect that it is so in
the case of the planets Jupiter and Saturn.</p>

<p>When we understand more about the properties of
matter, the nature of magnetism, as well as of gravity,
may be revealed to us.</p>

SOME EFFECTS OF THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE
UPON SUNLIGHT</h2>


<p>It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of
the atmosphere to all forms of life upon the surface
of the earth. If there were no atmosphere there
would be no life, because it is through the agency of
the water-vapor, carbon-dioxide and oxygen in the atmosphere
that all life-processes are maintained.</p>

<p>If there were no atmosphere there would not only
be no life upon the earth; there would be also none
of the beautiful color effects produced by the passage
of sunlight through the atmosphere. There would be
no blue skies, no beautiful sunrise and sunset effects,
no twilight, no rainbows, no halos, no auroral displays,
no clouds, no rains, no rivers nor seas, no winds nor
storms. The heavens would be perfectly black except
in the direction of the heavenly bodies which would
shine as brilliantly by day as by night.</p>

<p>To understand how the atmosphere produces color
effects such as blue skies, sunrise and sunset tints, rainbows
and halos, as well as the twinkling of the stars,
and numerous other phenomena, we must know something
of the nature of light itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Light moves outward from any source, such as the
sun, in all directions radially, or along straight lines
(so long as it does not encounter a gravitational field)
with the unimaginable velocity of 186,000 miles per
second. As it advances it vibrates or oscillates back
and forth across its path in all directions at right
angles to this path, unless it is plane polarized light,
in which case its vibrations are confined to one
plane only.</p>

<p>These vibrations or oscillations of light take the form
of a wavelike motion, one wave-length being the
distance passed over in the time of one vibration,
measured from crest to crest or from trough to
trough of adjacent waves.</p>

<p>We may consider that a beam or ray of sunlight
is made up of a great number of individual rays of
different wave-lengths and different colors. The average
wave-length of light, the wave-length of the green
ray in sunlight, is about one-fifty-thousandth part of
an inch, that is, it would take about fifty-thousand
wave-lengths of green light to cover a space of one
inch. Now, since light makes one vibration in passing
over a distance of one wave-length, it makes fifty
thousand vibrations, while advancing one inch, and
since it advances one hundred and eighty-six thousand
miles in one second we can easily figure out that a
ray of sunlight of average wave-length makes about
six hundred trillion vibrations (600,000,000,000,000)
in a single second!</p>

<p>The chief colors of which sunlight or white light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
is composed are red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
indigo and violet, though there are an infinite number
of gradations of color which blend into one another,
gradually producing the intermediate tints and shades.
The colors just mentioned are called the primary
colors of the solar spectrum, which can be produced
as a band of light of variegated colors, arranged in
the order named by passing a ray of ordinary sunlight
through a glass prism. The individual rays of
different color and wave-length that make up a beam
of sunlight, or white light, then separate out in the
order of the wave-lengths. The red rays vibrate the
most slowly and have the longest wave-length of
all the rays of the visible spectrum. About four
hundred trillion vibrations of red light reach the eye
in one second. Violet rays, on the other hand, vibrate
the most rapidly of all the visible rays and have the
shortest wave-length. About eight hundred trillion
vibrations of violet light reach the eye every second.
The wave-lengths of the intermediate colors decrease
in length progressively from the red to the violet and,
of course, the frequencies of their vibrations increase
in the same order. All sunlight is made up of these
rays of different colors and different vibration frequencies,
and of other rays as well, to which the human
eye is not sensitive, and which, therefore, do not
appear in the visible spectrum. Among these invisible
rays are the infra-red rays which come just below
the red of the visible spectrum, and which are of
longer wave-length than the red rays, and the ultra-violet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
rays, which lie beyond the violet rays of the
visible spectrum, and are of shorter wave-length than
the violet rays.</p>

<p>Now a ray of ordinary sunlight is separated into
the rays of various colors, which form the solar spectrum
when it passes from a medium of one density
obliquely to a medium of another density, as when it
passes from air to glass, or from air to water, or from
outer space into the earth's atmosphere. Under such
circumstances its velocity is slowed down when it
passes from a rare to a denser medium, and the waves
of different wave-lengths are bent from their former
course, or refracted, by different amounts. The red
rays, of longest wave-length, are bent from their former
course the least, and the violet rays, of shortest wave-length,
are bent the most upon passing from a rare
to a denser medium. As a result the ray of sunlight
is spread out or dispersed into its rays of different
wave-length and color upon entering a medium of
different density. It is this refraction and dispersion
of sunlight that produces many color effects in the
earth's atmosphere.</p>

<p>The atmosphere is not of uniform density throughout.
At high altitudes it is extremely rare. That is, there
is little of it in a given volume. Close to the earth's
surface, however, it is comparatively dense. Half of
all the atmosphere is within three and one-half miles of
the surface and half of the remainder lies within the
next three and a half miles. We may consider it as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
made up, on the whole, of layers of different densities,
strongly compressed near the surface.</p>

<p>Imagine a ray of sunlight entering the earth's atmosphere
from without. If it comes from a point in
the zenith its course is not changed upon entering the
atmosphere, because light passing from a certain
medium&mdash;as space&mdash;into a medium of different density,
is not bent from its course, or refracted, provided it
enters the new medium in a direction perpendicular to
the surface. If it enters the atmosphere (which is
the new medium of greater density) <em>obliquely</em>, refraction,
or bending of the ray, takes place, and as the
ray advances toward the earth, through layers of
increasing densities, it is bent from its former course
more and more. As the advancing rays of different
colors and wave-lengths in the beam of sunlight are
slowed down in the new medium, the red rays are
turned from their course the least and the violet rays
the most and the entire advancing wave-front of the
beam of sunlight is bent down more and more toward
the horizon, as it proceeds through the atmosphere.
As we on the earth's surface see the ray not along
its bent course through the atmosphere, but in the
direction in which it finally enters our eyes, the effect
of refraction upon a ray of light passing through the
atmosphere is to displace the object in the direction
of the zenith or increase its distance above the horizon.
As a result of refraction we see the sun&mdash;or moon&mdash;above
the western horizon after it has really set, and
above the eastern horizon before it has really risen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
The oval shape that the sun, or moon, often presents
on rising or setting, is due to the fact that the light
from the lower limb is passing through denser air
than the light from the upper limb, and so is refracted
more. As a result the lower limb is lifted proportionately
more than the upper limb. This distorts the
form of the solar or lunar disk, making it appear oval
instead of circular.</p>

<p>The familiar twinkling or scintillation of stars and,
more rarely, of the planets, is a result of interference
of light waves due to irregular and variable refraction
in air that is not uniform in density, owing to the
presence of constantly rising and descending atmospheric
currents of different densities. This also produces
the shimmering or unsteadiness of star images
in the telescope, that interferes so greatly with accurate
measurements of angles or observations of planetary
markings.</p>

<p>One may ask why it is, if light from an object,
say a star, is bent from its course and separated into
rays of various colors upon entering the earth's atmosphere,
that we do not see the object drawn out
into a band of spectral colors. It is because the angular
separation of the various colors is so slight under
ordinary circumstances that light from one point is
blended with light from a neighboring point of complementary
color to produce white light again. Under
certain circumstances, however, beautiful color effects
may be seen in the earth's atmosphere as a result of
the refraction of sunlight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>The blue color of the sky and its brightness is
caused by the scattering of the rays of shortest wave-length,
the violet and blue rays, by the oxygen and
nitrogen in the upper atmosphere. The molecules of
these gases interfere with the passage of these rays,
powerfully scattering and dispersing them, and thus
increasing the length of their path through the air
and diffusing their color and brightness in the upper
atmosphere, while permitting rays of longer wave-length,
the red and orange, to pass on practically
undisturbed.</p>

<p>When an object in the heavens lies close to the
horizon, the rays of light from it have to travel a
longer path through the atmosphere than when the
object is overhead, and that too through the densest
part of the atmosphere, which lies close to the earth's
surface, and in which are floating many dust particles
and impurities from the earth's surface. All these
particles, as well as the increased density of the atmosphere,
interfere with the free passage of the
rays, especially of shorter wave-lengths. The violet
and blue rays are sifted out and scattered in their
long journey through the lower strata of air, far
more than when they come to us from an object high
in the sky. Even the red and yellow rays are more
or less scattered and bent aside&mdash;diffracted&mdash;by these
comparatively large particles near the surface. The
reddish color of the sun, moon and even of the stars
and planets, when seen near the horizon, as well as
the beautiful sunset tints, in which reds and pinks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and yellows predominate, are due to the fact that the
rays of longer wave-length are more successful in
penetrating the dense, dust-laden layers of the lower
atmosphere. It is to be free of the dust and impurities
as well as the unsteadiness of the lower atmosphere,
that observatories are built at high altitudes whenever
possible.</p>

<p>When there have been unusually violent volcanic
eruptions, and great quantities of finely divided dust
have been thrown into the upper atmosphere, the effect
upon the blue and violet rays from the sun is very
great. The volcanic dust particles are so large that
instead of scattering these rays of shorter wave-length,
as do the oxygen and nitrogen in our atmosphere,
they reflect them back into space and so decrease the
amount of light and heat received from the sun. For
this reason the general temperature of the earth is
lowered by violent volcanic eruptions. Unusually
cold periods, that lasted for months, followed the terrible
eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 and of Katmai in
1912.</p>

<p>At times when much dust is present in the atmosphere,
the sky is a milky white color by day as a
result of the reflection of sunlight from the dust
particles. Sunrise and sunset colors are then particularly
gorgeous, with reds predominating. At such
times the blue and violet rays are almost completely
shut out, and the red, orange and yellow rays are
powerfully diffracted and scattered by the dust particles
in the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>The twilight glow that is visible for some time
before sunrise or after sunset is, of course, entirely
an atmospheric effect caused by the reflection of
sunlight to our eyes from the upper atmosphere, upon
which the sun shines, while it is, itself, concealed from
our view below the horizon. The atmosphere extends
in quantities sufficient to produce twilight to an
elevation of about sixty miles.</p>

<p>When <em>all</em> the rays of which sunlight is composed
are reflected in equal proportions we get the impression
of white light. Dust and haze in the air reflect all
rays strongly and give a whitish color to an otherwise
blue sky. Brilliant white clouds appear white, because
they are reflecting all rays equally. Clouds or portions
of clouds appear black when they are in shade or,
at times, by contrast with portions that are more
strongly illuminated, or when they are moisture-laden
and near the point of saturation, when they are absorbing
more light than they reflect. At sunrise and
sunset, when the light that falls upon the clouds is
richest in red and orange and yellow, clouds reflect
these colors to our eyes, and we see the brilliant
sunset hues which are more intense the more the
air is filled with dust and impurities.</p>

<p>The familiar and beautiful phenomenon of the rainbow
is produced by refraction, reflection and interference
of sunlight by drops of falling water, such
as rain or spray. As the ray of sunlight enters
the drop of water, which acts as a tiny glass prism, it
is refracted or bent from its course and spread out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
into its spectral colors. Reflection of these rays next
takes place (once or twice, as the case may be) from
the inside of the drop and a second refraction of
the reflected ray takes place as it leaves the drop. The
smaller the drops the more brilliant is the rainbow
and the richer in color. The most brilliant rainbows
are produced by drops between 0.2 and 0.4 millimeters
in diameter. In addition to the primary bow, which
has a red outer border with a radius of 42°, there
is the secondary bow with a radius of about 51° and
with colors reversed, the red being on the inner border;
the supernumerary bows which are narrow bands of
red, or green and red, appear parallel to the primary
and secondary bows along the inner side of the primary
bow and the outer side of the secondary bow. No
rainbow arches ever appear between the primary and
secondary bows, and it can be shown in fact, that
the illumination between these two bows is at a
minimum.</p>

<p>The primary, secondary and supernumerary bows
all lie opposite the sun in the direction of the observer's
shadow and the observer must stand with
his back to the sun in order to see them. The primary
and secondary rainbow arches take the form of arcs
of circles that have their common center on the
line connecting the sun with the observer at a point
as far below the horizon in angular distance as the
sun is above the horizon. It is, therefore, never
possible to see a rainbow arch of more than a semicircle
in extent unless the observer is at an elevation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
above the surrounding country, under which circumstances
it might be possible to see a complete circle
formed by the rainbow.</p>

<p>The highest and longest arch appears when the sun
is on the horizon, and the greater the altitude of the
sun the smaller and lower the visible arch. As the
angular radius of the primary bow is 42° and of the
secondary bow 51° and as the common center of the
two circles is always as far below the horizon as the
sun is above, it is never possible to see either primary
or secondary rainbow when the altitude of the sun
is over 51°, or the primary bow when the altitude
is over 42°. For this reason rainbows are rarely
seen at or near noon in mid-latitudes, since the sun is
usually at an elevation of more than 42° at noon,
especially in the summer season, which is also the
most favorable season for rainbows, owing to the
great likelihood of rain and sunshine occurring at the
same time.</p>

<p>The light which comes to an observer from the
primary bow is once reflected within the drop, and that
which comes from the secondary bow is twice reflected
within the drop. The sharper and brighter light
therefore comes from the primary bow of 42° radius.
The space between the two bows is particularly dark,
because it can be shown that the drops there do not
reflect any light at all.</p>

<p>The rainbow colors are rarely pure or arranged in
spectral order, owing to interference of light waves.
It is the interference of light waves from different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
parts of the same drop that produces the bands of
alternate maximum and minimum brightness, that lie
below the primary bow and beyond the secondary
bow. The red or green and red bands of maximum
brightness produced thus by interference, are called
the supernumerary bows, and they are always found
parallel to the primary and secondary bow within the
former and above the latter.</p>

<p>The distance of the rainbow from the observer is
the distance of the drops that form it. A rainbow
may be formed by clouds several miles distant or by
the aid of the garden hose on our lawn. No two
observers can see exactly the same rainbow because
the rainbow arch encircles the surface of a cone
whose vertex is at the observer's eye and no two
such vertices can exactly coincide. Two observers
see rainbows formed by different drops.</p>

<p>Refraction of light by ice-crystals in clouds produces
many beautiful color effects, such as halos of
various types around sun or moon, vertical light pillars,
circumzenithal arcs, and parhelia&mdash;"sun-dogs"&mdash;or
paraselenæ&mdash;"moon-dogs"&mdash;which are luminous
spots at equal altitudes with sun or moon&mdash;one to the
left the other to the right, at an angular distance
of 22°.</p>

<p>The most usual form of halo is that of 22° radius.
This is a luminous ring of light surrounding sun or
moon, with the inner edge red and sharply defined
and the spectral colors proceeding outward in order;
red is frequently the only color visible, the remainder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
of the ring appearing whitish. Since the halo is produced
by refraction of light by ice-crystals, which
exist in clouds of a certain type gathering at high
altitudes, it is always a very good indicator of an
approaching storm.</p>

<p>Coronas are luminous rings showing the spectral
colors in the reverse order, that is, with the inner edge
blue instead of red. They are usually of very small
radius, scarcely two degrees, closely surrounding sun
or moon and are produced&mdash;not by refraction&mdash;but
by <i>diffraction</i> or a bending aside of the rays as they
pass between&mdash;without entering&mdash;very small drops of
water in clouds. As in the case of refraction, the red
rays are turned from their course the least and the
violet rays the most.</p>

<p>Many of these phenomena&mdash;halos, luminous spots,
vertical pillars and arcs of light may, at times, be
seen simultaneously, when clouds of ice-crystals are
forming around the sun or moon. They then present
a very complex and beautiful outline of luminous
circles, arches and pillars that have a mysterious and
almost startling appearance when the cause is not
clearly understood.</p>

<p>We have found then that sunlight is made up of
rays of many different wave-lengths and colors and
that the atmosphere acts upon these rays in various
ways. It reflects them or turns them back on their
course; it refracts them as they pass through the gases
of which the atmosphere consists, or through the
water-vapor and ice-crystals suspended in it, thus sifting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
out and dispersing the rays of different colors and
wave-lengths and producing beautiful color effects; it
<i>diffracts</i> them or bends them aside as they pass between
the fine dust particles and small drops of water in
the air, again sifting out the rays of different colors
and producing color effects similar to those produced
by refraction; it also scatters and disperses,
through the action of the molecules of oxygen and
nitrogen in the upper strata, the blue and violet rays
of shorter wave-length and thus produces the blue
color and brightness of the sky; it produces beautifully
colored auroral streamers and curtains and rays of
light through the electrical discharges resulting when
the rarefied gases in the upper air are bombarded by
electrified particles shot forth from the sun.</p>

<p>It is our atmosphere, then, that we have to thank
for all these beautiful displays of color that delight
our eyes and give pleasure to our existence, as well
as for the very fact of our existence upon a planet that
without its presence would be an uninhabitable waste,
covered only with barren rocks.</p>

<h2><a name="XXVI" id="XXVI">XXVI</a><br /><br />

KEEPING TRACK OF THE MOON</h2>


<p>Of all celestial objects the nearest and most familiar
is our satellite, the moon. Yet the mistakes and
blunders that otherwise intelligent persons frequently
make when they refer to the various aspects of the
moon are quite unbelievable.</p>

<p>Who has not read in classics or in popular fiction
of crescent moons riding high in midnight skies, of full
moons rising above western cliffs or setting beyond
eastern lakes? Who has not seen the moon drawn
in impossible positions with horns pointing toward the
horizon, or a twinkling star shining through an apparently
transparent moon?</p>

<p>Careful observation of the moon in all its various
phases and at different seasons is the best method
to be used in acquiring a knowledge of the elementary
facts regarding the motion of the moon through the
heavens from day to day, but that requires that one
be up often after midnight and in the early hours
preceding dawn and so it is that we feel so hazy in
regard to what happens to the moon after it has
passed the full.</p>

<p>A few fundamental rules can be easily acquired,
however, and these will enable us to locate the moon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
in the right quarter of the heavens at any time of the
day or night when we know its phase and the approximate
position of the sun at the same instant, and thus
we may avoid some of the most obvious blunders that
are made in dealing with the general aspect of the
moon at any given time.</p>

<p>As can be verified by direct observation, the moon
is always moving continually eastward. Since it makes
a complete revolution around the earth from new
moon back to new moon again in a little less than
thirty days, it passes over about twelve degrees a
day (360° divided by 30), on the average, or one-half
a degree an hour, which is about the angular extent
of its own diameter. Therefore every hour the moon
moves eastward a distance equal to its own diameter.
This is of course only approximate as the moon moves
more rapidly in some parts of its orbit than in others.</p>

<p>In addition to its real eastward motion the moon
shares the apparent daily westward motion of all
celestial objects which is due to the daily rotation of
the earth on its axis in the opposite direction. That
is, the moon, as well as the sun, stars and planets,
rises in the east and sets in the west daily. On
account of its continuous eastward motion, however,
the moon rises later every night, on the average
about fifty minutes, though the amount of this daily
retardation of moon-rise varies from less than half
an hour to considerably over an hour at different
seasons of the year and in different latitudes. In the
course of a month then the moon has risen at all hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of the day and night and set at all hours of the day
and night.</p>

<p>It might seem unnecessary to emphasize the fact
that the moon always rises in the east were it not
that the astronomer occasionally meets the man who
insists that he has at times seen the moon rise in
the west.</p>

<p>To be sure the new crescent moon first becomes
visible above the western horizon shortly after
sunset though it rises in the east the morning of the
same day shortly after sunrise. As is also true of
the sun the exact point on the horizon where the
moon rises or sets varies from day to day and from
season to season. In one month the moon passes over
very nearly the same path through the heavens that
the sun does in one year, for the moon's path is inclined
only five degrees to the ecliptic or apparent path
of the sun through the heavens. It can never pass
more than 28&frac12;° (23&frac12;° + 5°) south of the celestial
equator, nor more than 28&frac12;° north of it. It has
a slightly greater range in altitude than the sun,
therefore. North of 28&frac12;° north latitude it always
crosses the meridian south of the zenith and below
28&frac12;° south latitude it crosses the meridian north
of the zenith. In tropical regions the moon sometimes
passes north of the zenith, sometimes south, or again
directly through the zenith.</p>

<p>Since the full moon is always diametrically opposite
to the sun it passes over nearly the same part of the
heavens that the sun did six months before. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
winter then when the sun is south of the equator
the moon "rides high" at night north of the equator
and, vice versa, in summer when the sun is north of
the equator the full moon "rides low" south of the
equator. In winter then we have more hours of moonlight
than we have in summer. This may be of no
great advantage in mid-latitudes but we may imagine
what a boon it is to the inhabitants of the Arctic
and Antarctic regions to have the friendly moon
above the horizon during the long winter months when
the sun is never seen for days at a time.</p>

<p>At time of "new" moon the moon lies directly
between us and the sun, but ordinarily passes just
to the north or south of the sun since its orbit is
inclined five degrees to the ecliptic or plane of the
earth's orbit. If the moon's path lay exactly in the
ecliptic we would have an eclipse of the sun every
month at new moon and an eclipse of the moon two
weeks later at full moon. Now the moon crosses
the ecliptic twice a month, the points of crossing
being called the nodes of its orbit, but only twice a
year is the moon nearly enough in line with the sun
at the time it crosses to cause eclipses. Every year,
then, there are two "eclipse seasons," separated by
intervals of six months, when the moon is in line with
the sun at or close to the point where it crosses the
ecliptic; then and only then can solar and lunar eclipses
occur. The solar eclipses, of course, will occur when
the moon is new, that is, when the moon passes directly
between the earth and the sun and throws its shadow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
over the earth; and the lunar eclipses two weeks
later when the earth passes between the sun and moon
and throws its shadow over the face of the moon.</p>

<p>Probably there is no astronomical subject that
has been more generally misunderstood than that of
solar and lunar eclipses. It is well to remember that
solar eclipses can only occur at time of new moon and
lunar eclipses only at the time of full moon; and at
the time of eclipses, whether lunar or solar, the moon
is at or near its nodes, the points where its orbit
crosses the ecliptic. There are always at least two
solar eclipses every year and there may be as many
as five. There are years when there are no lunar
eclipses, though ordinarily both solar and lunar eclipses
occur every year, some partial others total.</p>

<p>The moon shines only by reflected sunlight. It is
of itself a solid, dark body with its day surface intensely
hot and its night surface intensely cold, a
world of extreme temperatures.</p>

<p>At new moon all of the night side of the moon is
turned toward us, at full moon all of the day side. At
other phases we see part of the day side and part of
the night side and the illuminated side of the moon
is always the side that is towards the sun. Failure
to observe this simple rule leads to many grievous
blunders in depicting the moon.</p>

<p>At the time of new moon the moon, moving continually
eastward, passes north or south of the sun
from west to east except when it passes directly in
front of the sun, causing eclipses. A day or so later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the waxing crescent moon or the "new moon," as it
is popularly called, becomes visible low in the west
immediately after sunset. The moon is now east of
the sun and will remain east of the sun until the time
of full moon. During the period from new moon to
full moon it will, therefore, rise after the sun and
set after the sun. The waxing crescent moon will
not be visible in the morning hours because, inasmuch
as it rises after the sun, it is lost to view in the sun's
brilliant rays. Nevertheless, it follows the sun across
the sky and becomes visible in the west as soon as
the sun has disappeared below the western horizon.
The thin illuminated crescent has its horns or cusps
turned <em>away</em> from the point where the sun has set.
The horns of the crescent can never point <em>toward</em>
the horizon since the illuminated side of the moon is
always turned toward the sun whether the sun is above
or below our horizon.</p>

<p>As hour by hour and day by day the moon draws
farther eastward and increases its angular distance
from the sun, more and more of the illuminated side
becomes visible; the crescent increases in width and
area and the moon appears higher in the western sky
each night at sunset.</p>

<p>Usually about seven and a fraction days after the
date of new moon the moon completes the first quarter
of its revolution around the earth. The period
from one phase to the next is variable and irregular,
being sometimes less than seven days and at other
times more than eight days, since the moon does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
move at a uniform rate in different parts of its orbit.</p>

<p>When the moon has completed the first quarter
of a revolution it is ninety degrees east of the sun
and presents the phase known as "half-moon" since
half of the surface that is turned toward the earth
is illuminated and half is in darkness. It is said to
be "at the first quarter." The illuminated half is of
course the western half because the sun is to the
west of the moon. The half moon is near the
meridian at sunset and sets near midnight. Up to
the first quarter, then, the moon is a crescent in the
western sky during the first part of the night and
should never be represented as east of the meridian or
near the meridian at midnight.</p>

<p>After the moon has passed the first quarter and
before it is full more than half of the side turned
toward the earth is illuminated and it is in the "gibbous"
phase. It is still the western limb that is fully
illuminated. The moon is now east of the meridian
at sunset and it crosses the meridian before midnight
and sets before sunrise. All who are abroad during
the first half of the night find this phase of the moon
more favorable to them than the gibbous phase following
full moon.</p>

<p>The moon now being above the horizon at sunset
is visible continuously from sunset to midnight but
sets some time during the second half of the night,
while the full moon shines throughout the night,
rising in the east at sunset and setting in the west
at sunrise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>When the moon is full it is 180° east, or west, of
the sun and so both its eastern and western limbs
are perfectly illuminated. After the full the moon goes
through its phases in reverse order, being first gibbous,
then a half-moon once more, and lastly a waning
crescent.</p>

<p>It is now west instead of east of the sun and so
it is the eastern limb that is fully illuminated by the
sun. Being west of the sun it will now rise before the
sun and set before the sun, the interval decreasing each
day as the moon draws in toward the sun once more.</p>

<p>The gibbous phase preceding full moon is favorable
to all abroad before midnight but the gibbous phase
following full moon is more favorable to those who
are abroad after midnight, for from full moon to last
quarter the moon is below the horizon at sunset, and
of course, is rising later and later each night, while
at sunrise it is still above the horizon, appearing each
day higher and higher above the western horizon at
sunrise as it approaches the third or last quarter.</p>

<p>When it has reached this point it is once more a
half-moon, though now it is the eastern half instead
of the western half of the disk that is fully illuminated.
The moon is 90° west of the sun at third quarter and
from this phase to the phase of new moon it is a
crescent once more, but now a waning instead of a
waxing crescent. It appears east of the meridian
before sunrise and as the crescent grows thinner it
draws nearer and nearer to the eastern horizon and
the rising sun. As with the waxing crescent moon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the horns are turned away from the horizon. The
waning crescent moon is always to be looked for east
of the meridian and to be associated with the rising
sun, while the waxing crescent moon is to be looked
for west of the meridian and associated with the
setting sun. Neither the waxing nor the waning
crescent moon will be visible during the midnight
hours.</p>

<p>As the waning crescent moon grows thinner and
draws in closer to the sun each successive night, its
time of rising precedes that of the sun by an ever-decreasing
interval until finally the crescent disappears
from view in the eastern sky; the next day we see
no crescent either in the eastern or western skies&mdash;the
moon is once more in conjunction with the sun
and "new." One revolution of the moon about the
earth with respect to the sun has been completed and
a day or so later we may look for a new crescent
moon in the western sky after sunset.</p>

<h2><a name="XXVII" id="XXVII">XXVII</a><br /><br />

THE MOTIONS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES</h2>


<p>About three hundred and twenty years ago
Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake for his
audacity in believing in the existence of other worlds.
A few decades later the famous astronomer Galileo
was forced to publicly recant his belief that the earth
moved. Yet the truth could not long be suppressed
by such means, and since those dark days man's advance
in knowledge has been so rapid that it seems
to us today in this wonderful age of scientific discovery
almost inconceivable that man ever believed that
the earth, a tiny planet of a vast solar system, was
"the hub of the universe," the fixed and immovable
center about which revolved all the heavenly bodies.
Very reluctantly, however, and with bitter feeling, but
in the light of overwhelming evidence man finally gave
up his long-cherished idea of terrestrial importance,
and when finally forced to move his fixed center of
the universe, he moved it only so far as the comparatively
nearby sun.</p>

<p>This center he then regarded as fixed in space and
also held to his belief that the stars, set in an imaginary
celestial sphere, were immovable in space as well, and
all at the same distance from the sun. So, scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
two hundred years ago we find that the astronomer
Bradley was endeavoring to measure this common
distance of the "fixed stars." Though he failed in
this attempt he made the important discovery that the
observed positions of the stars are not their true positions,
owing to the fact that the velocity of light is
not infinite but takes a definite finite interval of time
to travel a given distance. As a result the stars always
appear displaced in the direction of the earth's motion
around the sun, the amount of the displacement depending
upon the velocity of the earth in its orbit
and the velocity of light. This "aberration of light,"
as it is called, furnished additional proof that the earth
revolves about the sun and was one more nail driven
into the coffin of the old Ptolemaic theory that the
earth was the center of the universe. Bradley also
discovered that the positions of the stars were affected
by the wabbling of the earth's axis, called its "nutation."</p>

<p>Although in the days of Bradley neither the methods
of observation nor the instruments were sufficiently
accurate to show the minute shifts in the positions of
the stars that reveal the individual motions of the stars
and the distances of those nearest to us, yet the discovery
of the two large displacements in the positions
of all the stars, due to the aberration of light and the
nodding of the earth's axis were of the greatest value,
for they were a necessary step in the direction of the
precise measurements of modern times. It is only
through measurements of the greatest refinement and
accuracy that it is possible to detect the motions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
distances of the stars and to discover the wonderful
truths about the nature and structure of the universe
that they are revealing to us today.</p>

<p>After unsuccessful attempts extending over several
centuries the distance of one of the nearest stars, the
faint 61 Cygni, as it is catalogued, was finally determined
by the astronomer Bessel in the year 1838.</p>

<p>This star is about ten light-years distant from the
earth, which places it about six hundred and thirty
thousand times farther away from us than the sun;
that is, we would have to travel six hundred and thirty
thousand times the distance from the earth to the
sun to reach this very close stellar neighbor, 61 Cygni.
The <em>nearest</em> of all the stars, Alpha Centauri, is over
two hundred and seventy thousand times the distance
from the earth to the sun. It is, therefore, little
wonder that the early astronomers believed that the
stars were fixed in space since even the nearest is
so far away that, viewed from opposite points in the
earth's orbit, its apparent change in position due to
our actual change in position of 186,000,000 miles,
amounts to only one and a half seconds of arc. Two
stars separated by <em>one hundred and sixty times</em> this
angular distance might possibly be glimpsed as two
distinct stars by a person with good eyesight, though to
most of us they would appear as one star. Upon the
measurement of such minute angles depended a knowledge
of the distances of the nearest stars.</p>

<p>It is to Sir William Herschel that we owe the discovery,
more than a hundred years ago, of the motion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of the sun through the universe. From the consideration
of a long series of observations of the positions
of the stars this famous astronomer discovered
that the stars in the direction of the constellation
Hercules were separated by much greater angular
distances than the stars diametrically opposite in the
heavens. In other words, the stars were spreading
apart in one portion of the heavens and crowding
together in the opposite direction and he rightly interpreted
this to mean that the sun was moving in the
direction of the constellation of Hercules. It was not
until the spectroscope was applied to the study of
the heavens in the latter part of the nineteenth century
that the amount of this motion of the sun was found
to be about twelve and a half miles per second, or four
times the distance from the earth to the sun in
a year.</p>

<p>It is to Sir William Herschel that we owe also the
discovery of binary systems of stars in which two
stars swing around a point between them called their
center of gravity.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Spiral Nebula in Canes Venatici</span></p>

<p class="center">Taken with 60-inch Reflector of the Mt. Wilson Observatory</p></div>
</div>

<p>Our first conception of the immensity and grandeur
of the universe dates from the time of the older
Herschel only a century or so ago. The mysterious
nebulæ and star clusters were then discovered, the wonders
of the Milky Way were explored, and a new planet
and satellites in our own solar system were discovered.
It was found that the sun and the stars as well as
the planets were in motion. Neither sun nor earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
could be regarded any longer as a fixed point in
the universe.</p>

<p>With the application of the spectroscope to the study
of the heavens toward the end of the nineteenth century
the key to a treasure-house of knowledge was placed
in the hands of the astronomers of modern times and
as a result we are now learning more, in a few decades,
about the wonders and mysteries of the heavens than
was granted to man to learn in centuries of earlier
endeavor. Yet it is the feeling of the astronomer of
today that he is only standing on the threshold of
knowledge and that the greatest of all discoveries, that
of the nature of matter and of time and space is yet
to be made.</p>

<p>It is the spectroscope that tells us so many wonderful
facts about the motions of the stars, nebulæ and star
clusters. It tells us also practically all we know about
the physical condition of our own sun and of the
other suns of the universe, their temperature and age,
and the peculiarities of their atmospheres.</p>

<p>Some of the most important astronomical discoveries
that have been made in the past few years have to
do with the distribution and velocities of the heavenly
bodies as revealed by the spectroscope.</p>

<p>It has been found, with the aid of the spectroscope,
that the most slowly moving of all stars are the extremely
hot bluish Orion stars with an average velocity
of eight miles per second, while the most rapidly
moving stars are the deep-red stars with an average
velocity of twenty-one miles per second, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
is in all cases a relationship existing between the color,
or spectrum, of a star and its velocity. The reason
for this connection between the two still remains
undiscovered.</p>

<p>The spectroscope has also told us some astonishing
facts in recent years about the velocities of the
spiral nebulæ.</p>

<p>It is now known that these mysterious objects are
moving with the tremendous average velocity of
<em>four hundred and eighty miles per second</em>, which exceeds
the average velocity of the stars fully twenty-five
fold. They possess, moreover, internal motions
of rotation that are almost as high as their velocities
through space. It is now generally believed that spiral
nebulæ are far distant objects of enormous size and
mass, exterior to our own system of stars and similar
to it in form.</p>

<p>In place of the universe of the "fixed stars" and
the immovable sun or earth of a few centuries ago we
find that modern astronomical discovery is substituting
a universe of inconceivable grandeur and immensity in
a state of ceaseless flux and change.</p>

<p>Our earth&mdash;an atom spinning about on its axis
and revolving rapidly around a huge sun that is equal
in volume to more than a million earths&mdash;is carried
onward with this sun through a vast universe of suns.</p>

<p>Only an average-sized star among several hundred
million other stars is this huge sun of ours, moving
with its planet family through the regions of the
Milky Way, where are to be found not only moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
clusters and groups of stars, speeding along their
way in obedience to the laws of motion of the system
to which they belong, but also strangely formed nebulæ
covering vast stretches of space, whirling and seething
internally and shining with mysterious light, and still
other stretches of dark obscuring matter shutting off
the rays of suns beyond.</p>

<p>The extent and form of this enormous system of
stars and nebulæ and the laws that govern the motions
of its individual members are among the problems
that the astronomers of today are attempting to
solve. On both sides of these regions of the Milky
Way, wherein lies our own solar system, lie other
vast systems, such as the globular star clusters, composed
of thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands,
of suns; the Magellanic clouds, which resemble detached
portions of the Milky Way, and, probably, the
much discussed spiral nebulæ, possible "island universes"
similar to our own.</p>

<p>We have come far in the past three hundred years
from the conception of an immovable earth at the
center of the universe to this awe-inspiring conception
of the universe that we have today, which is based
upon modern astronomical discoveries.</p>

<p>Whatever may be discovered in the future in regard
to the form and extent of the universe the idea of
a fixed and immovable center either within the solar
system or among the stars beyond has gone from
the minds of men at last.</p>

<p>Not more than a generation ago a survival of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
old idea of a fixed center was seen in the belief that
Alcyone, in the Pleiades was a "central sun" about
which all the stars revolved. It is now well known
that the Pleiades form a moving star cluster. Alcyone
is therefore drifting slowly onward through the universe
and the idea of a fixed and immovable center
to which man may anchor his ideas is drifting away
also. There are, it is true, local centers of systems,
such, for instance, as the sun occupies in the solar
system or some group of stars may occupy in the stellar
system to which our sun belongs, yet <em>as a whole</em> these
systems move on and their centers with them. There
is no evidence today that any absolutely immovable
point exists in the heavens.</p>

<p>No celestial object has been found to be without
the attribute of <em>motion</em>, not only motion <em>onward</em>
through the universe, but also <em>rotational</em> motion about
an axis of the body. The planets rotate on their
axes as well as revolve about the sun, and the sun
also turns on its axis as it moves onward through
space. This rotational motion is also found in the
nebulæ and star clusters as well as in the stars and
planets. No object in the heavens is known to be
without it. Even the slowly drifting Orion nebula
possesses a rapid internal velocity of rotation. There
is no such thing as a body absolutely at rest in the
universe.</p>

<h2><a name="XXVIII" id="XXVIII">XXVIII</a><br /><br />

THE EVOLUTION OF THE STARS&mdash;FROM
RED GIANTS TO RED DWARFS</h2>


<p>The most casual of star-gazers is aware that the
stars differ one from another in color and in
brightness. There are red stars, yellow stars, white
stars and bluish-white stars. There are the brilliant
stars of first magnitude such as Vega, Capella and
Antares, and there are, on the other hand, stars so
faint that they can barely be glimpsed with the most
powerful telescopes.</p>

<p>In general the most brilliant stars are the nearest
and the faintest stars are the most distant, but there
are many exceptions to the rule, since there are stars
that appear faint even when comparatively near because
they are small and shine with a feeble light.
Such a star is the faint, sixth-magnitude star, 61 Cygni,
one of the nearest of all the stars. Again, there are
stars in far-distant clusters visible only in powerful
telescopes that in actual brightness exceed our own
sun several thousand times and in volume several
million times. A star the size of the sun would be
invisible in the most powerful telescope in existence
if it were at the distance of many stars in the Milky
Way or globular star clusters.</p>

<p>Stars differ in color because they differ in temperature.
We are all aware of the fact that a piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
of iron when heated first glows a deep red, then appears
yellowish in color and finally attains to white
heat. It is the same among the stars. The red stars
are the coolest of all the stars and the bluish-white
stars are the hottest of all the stars, while intermediate
between them in temperature come the yellow
and the white stars.</p>

<p>Now as the biologist and the geologist see in this
world of ours signs of evolution, or gradual development
and change from the simple to the more complex
forms, and of growth and decay, so the astronomer
sees among the stars signs of a continuous, progressive
development from one type of star to another. Stars
share in the general evolution that is the law of the
universe, and are born, reach the height of their development,
decline to old age and die.</p>

<p>Within the past few years important astronomical
discoveries have been made that show the true order
of this evolution of the stars. It was believed not so
long ago that the blue-white helium stars&mdash;the type
B stars the astronomers called them, or the Orion stars,
since there are so many stars of this type in the constellation
of Orion&mdash;were not only the hottest but also
the youngest of the stars and that they represented the
first stage in the development of a star from a primitive
gaseous nebula such as the Great Orion Nebula.
It is now known that these brilliant, hot helium stars
represent the peak of development of the most massive
of all the stars and not the first stages in the
development.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>A star, it is now known, comes into existence as a
giant, reddish star of enormous size and of a density
only about one-thousandth that of the earth's atmosphere
at sea-level. It is inconceivably tenuous or rare,
and its temperature is comparatively low, about 3,000°
Centigrade or less. It is not evolved from the luminous,
gaseous nebulæ because red stars are never found
associated with the gaseous nebulæ, as are the blue-white
stars. The origin of these red giant stars is
uncertain, but it is possible that they may be gradually
evolved in some manner from the dark clouds of obscuring
matter or dark nebulæ that exists so abundantly
in the heavens.</p>

<p>In the next stage of its development the deep-red
giant star increases in temperature as it contracts under
the action of gravitation and its color gradually
changes from red to yellow. Its density increases
slightly and its volume decreases. It is now a yellow
giant star. As the evolution progresses in the course
of ages the star continues to contract, its temperature
increases greatly as does also its density and it continues
to decrease in volume. It is now a brilliant white
star, a hydrogen star, so called because its spectrum
is chiefly characterized by the lines of hydrogen.</p>

<p>As the star contracts under the gravitation of its
parts and increases in temperature and density there
comes more and more into play an important factor
that has a great effect upon its future development.
This is light-pressure or radiation pressure which acts
in opposition to gravity and exerts a strong outward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
pressure upon matter within the depths of the star,
tending to push it outward from the center where
the temperature is greatest and the light is most intense.
It is a most interesting fact that if the mass of a star, that
is the quantity of matter that it contains, exceeds a certain
value the pressure of light or radiation within it overbalances
the gravitational attraction that draws matter
towards its center and the star disintegrates or ceases
to exist as a star. This accounts for the fact that the
stars differ very little among themselves in the quantity
of matter that they contain, that is, in their masses,
though they may differ enormously in size. Stars that
exceed a certain mass will become unstable and this
may account for the association of luminous nebulæ
with the hottest of all stars, the nebulæ possibly being
puffed off from the surfaces of these stars under the
action of radiation pressure.</p>

<p>After a star has reached the height of its development
as a bluish-white helium star with a temperature
of something like 10,000° Centigrade and a density
about one-tenth that of the sun, it begins to lose heat
and to cool gradually though it continues to contract
and increase in density.</p>

<p>It is now on the descending scale of evolution and is
to be counted among the dwarfs instead of the giants.
A brilliant blue-white helium or Orion star is about
one hundred times more luminous than the sun, and its
diameter is about ten times that of the sun.</p>

<p>Our own sun, we find, is on the descending scale of
stellar evolution. It is a yellow dwarf star of temperature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
about 6,000° Centigrade and density one and one-fourth
that of water, which is probably about as great
a density as is attained by any star since even the non-luminous
planets Jupiter and Saturn have lower densities
than the sun.</p>

<p>The last stage in the development of a star is represented
by the dwarf red star of high density and
low temperature. The diameter of the dwarf red star
probably averages about five hundred thousand miles
and its temperature is 3,000° Centigrade or less. After
this we have the extinct stars, similar possibly to our
planet Jupiter, though considerably larger, with a dense
gaseous atmosphere and a certain degree of internal
heat.</p>

<p>We have traced the evolution of a star from a red
giant to a red dwarf through the intermediate stages
from yellow giant to a giant helium star with increasing
temperature and thence to yellow dwarf and red
dwarf as the temperature decreases. Only the most
massive stars pass through this entire chain of evolution.
Stars of small mass never attain to the splendor
of brilliant blue-white helium stars, but begin to decrease
in temperature and brightness before this stage
is reached.</p>

<p>The time required for the evolution of a star from
red giant to red dwarf is not known, but it must be very
great. The age of the earth, which is probably equal
to that of the solar system, is estimated as something
like one thousand million years. It is probable that
the average life of a star far exceeds this limit.</p>

<h2><a name="XXIX" id="XXIX">XXIX</a><br /><br />

DOUBLE AND MULTIPLE STARS</h2>


<p>The plan of the solar system which consists of a
central sun encircled by satellites that are far inferior
to their luminary in size, and that move about it
in orbits that are almost perfect circles, is not the only,
nor possibly, even the most general one in the universe.</p>

<p>Sweeping the heavens with powerful telescopes one is
astonished to find that myriads of stars can be separated
into two or more physically connected suns that
are often, moreover, of exquisitely tinted and contrasting
shades. Green and red, orange and blue, white
and golden or white and blue pairs exist in profusion,
and strange to say there are well-authenticated instances
of color changes taking place temporarily within
the same system. A pair of white stars has been known
to change within a few decades, first to golden yellow
and bluish green and then to orange and green. The
famous pair catalogued as "95 Herculis" was noted to
change from green and red to a palish yellow and back
to the original strongly contrasting hues within the
course of a single year, while at another time they appeared
to be a perfectly white pair. At the present
time both of these stars are decidedly yellowish in color.
Such changes in hue are probably due to temporary disturbances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
in the atmospheres of the stars, possibly of
an electrical nature or to sudden or unusual outbursts of
activity, concerning the origin of which we are as much
in doubt as we are of the cause of the sun-spot cycle
and periodic variation in the intensity of radiation of
our own sun. Temporary changes in the color of the
components of double star systems sometimes take place
when the two stars approach their "periastron" or point
of nearest approach. Owing to the great eccentricity
of the orbits of double stars, such stars are anywhere
from twice to nineteen times as near to each other at
periastron as they are at "apastron," or point of greatest
departure. Such great changes in the relative distances
of two physically connected suns would produce
marked changes in the intensity of the tides raised upon
each of them by their mutual gravitational attraction
and unusual outbursts of gases or electrical excitement
in the atmospheres of the stars might cause very noticeable
changes in the color of these stars as they drew
nearer to each other, which would subside as they receded
toward apastron.</p>

<p>In addition to "visual" double or multiple stars, there
exists a very extensive class of stars known as "spectroscopic
binaries," in which the two components are so
close to each other that even the most powerful telescopes
cannot divide them. It is only from the shifting
of the lines of their overlapping spectra, caused by their
alternate motion toward and from the earth as they
revolve about their common center of gravity, that their
duplex nature is revealed to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>In some instances one member of the system is so
faint that its spectrum is not visible and its presence
is disclosed only by the shifting of the lines of the
bright star.</p>

<p>According to Doppler's Law, when a star is approaching
the earth the lines of its spectrum shift toward the
blue end of the spectrum, and when the star is receding
from the earth the lines are shifted toward the red
end of the spectrum. The amount of this shift can be
very accurately measured, and gives the relative velocities
of the stars in their orbits directly in miles per second.
Knowing in addition, by observation, the period
of mutual revolution of the stars, it is possible to find
the dimensions of these spectroscopic binary systems
compared to our own solar system, and also the masses
of the stars compared to the mass of our own sun. If
the spectrum of the fainter star is not visible, only the
velocity of the brighter star with respect to the center
of gravity of the system can be found and the mass
found for the system comes out too small. In such
cases we can obtain only a lower limit for the mass
of the system. Then, too, it must be remembered that
these systems of stars lie at all angles with reference
to our line of sight, and so we rarely see the orbits in
their true form. The measured velocities are as a result
smaller than the true velocities, and on the average
amount to only sixty per cent. of the true orbital velocities.
The calculated masses of spectroscopic binary stars
are, therefore, in general only about sixty per cent. of
the true masses. It has been found from calculating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the masses of a number of binary systems, that the combined
masses of the stars in these systems do not differ
very greatly among themselves, nor as compared to our
own sun, though in light-giving power these stars may
differ hundreds, thousands, even millions of times. For
instance, there are stars that give only one ten-thousandth
part of the light of our own sun, and other
stars that give ten thousand times as much light as the
sun. Moreover, there are many instances of physically
connected stars differing thousands of times in
luminosity, though in mass, or quantity of matter found
in the stars, they differ only two or three times. Why
this is so remains one of the great mysteries of the
heavens, and makes it extremely difficult to give any
satisfactory theory of the origin of double-star systems.
It has never been explained satisfactorily why of two
suns physically connected and, therefore, presumably
originating at the same time, one should be radiating
with the greatest intensity, while the other is practically
an extinct sun, in spite of the fact that the quantity
of matter in the two bodies differs but slightly.</p>

<p>In a few systems the plane in which the stars revolve
passes so nearly through the earth that the two stars
temporarily eclipse one another during each revolution.
Such systems are called <i>eclipsing binaries</i>. To such
a system belongs the famous <i>Algol</i>. Its light waxes
and wanes periodically with the greatest punctuality in
a period of 2<sup>d</sup> 20<sup>h</sup> 48.9<sup>m</sup>, owing to its temporary eclipse
by a very large but extremely faint attendant sun. The
diameter of the faint star is slightly greater than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
diameter of the bright star which is about one million
miles in extent. The distance between the <em>centers</em> of
the stars is only about three million miles, which brings
their surfaces within two million miles of each other.
The masses of the two stars are in the ratio of two
to one, the brighter and more massive star being about
half as heavy as our own sun, though its density is
only about two-tenths that of the sun. The density of
the fainter star is still less, being only about half that
of the brighter star. Very low density of both components
and extreme faintness of one member compared
to the other, appears to be a very general characteristic
of closely associated eclipsing and spectroscopic binary
stars. Among the extremely hot and brilliant helium
and hydrogen stars, spectroscopic binaries exist in great
numbers. In fact, among these types there appear to be
as many binary and multiple systems as there are systems
of isolated suns. Sometimes these close binary
stars are egg-shaped or oval and revolve rapidly almost
in contact about their common center of gravity. Inhabitants
of satellites of such a system would see in
their heavens the, to us, strange and startling phenomenon
of <em>two</em> suns, each equal to our own or even greater
in size, whirling rapidly about each other and separated
by a space comparable in extent to their own
diameters. Eclipses in such a system would be of
daily occurrence, and, if one star were dark, would produce
for the satellite world the same effect of alternate
day and night that results from axial rotation of a
satellite. The two hemispheres of the faint companion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
sun would be very unequally illuminated owing to
the fact that the side turned toward the brilliant sun
would always reflect its neighbor's brightness in addition
to shining with its own comparatively feeble inherent
light, while the opposite hemisphere would shine
only by its own dim light, and would, therefore, be in
comparative darkness.</p>

<p>The spectroscopic binaries generally revolve closely
and rapidly about their common center of gravity;
there are to be found, on the other hand, among the
wider visual doubles, many systems wherein the components
are separated by distances comparable to the
distances of the outer planets, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune,
from the sun. It is evident that the individual
stars of such binary systems could not possibly be encircled
by any such extensive system of satellites as attends
our own sun, though satellites such as our own
planet Earth, or the inferior planets Mercury and
Venus, might conceivably encircle the individual components
of such binary systems at distances not greater
than that of the earth from the sun. No planet could
safely exist at a much greater distance from one of
these suns without being subject to most dangerous
perturbations and disruptive tidal forces arising from
the vicinity of the second sun. Granted that planets
might encircle one of these suns at a distance approximating
that of Venus or our own planet from the sun,
the inhabitants of such worlds would behold the strange
phenomenon of <em>two</em> suns in the heavens, not almost in
contact as in spectroscopic binary systems, but at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
time comparatively near and again in opposite portions
of the heavens as is the case with the sun and moon
in our own heavens. As the planet advanced in its orbit
about the ruling sun, the secondary sun would be visible
at first by day and again by night. If the two suns
were of contrasting hues, as, for instance, green and
red, there might appear in the nearby heavens at a
distance of one hundred million miles or so a magnificent
sun of deep reddish hue, equal to or surpassing our
own in splendor, while in a far distant part of the sky,
at a distance as great as that which separates us from
the planet Saturn, might appear a rival sun of greenish
hue, smaller and fainter, but nevertheless, hot and
extremely brilliant and capable of exerting through its
great gravitational attraction a most disturbing effect
upon the motion of the planet of its neighbor. At
times the rays of the two suns, red and green, would
combine to produce a day characterized by terrific heat
and intense illumination. Again the green orb would
rise in the east as the red sun set in the west and night
would be turned into a weird, dimly-lighted day by the
greenish rays of the secondary sun. Compared to the
wonders and beauties of the heavens in such a system,
our own well-regulated and orderly planet family,
undisturbed by the exciting proximity of a rival sun,
seems to pale into insignificance. Yet we have every
good reason to be content with the ordering of affairs
within our own solar system, and to feel relief rather
than regret at the absence of a secondary sun. In a
planet world revolving about one member of a double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
star system, we may imagine the dread rather than pleasure
with which the periodic near-approach of a rival
sun would be hailed, and even the possible hurried migration
from exposed to sheltered portions of the planetary
world to escape the rapidly increasing heat and
intensity of light from the approaching sun. In such
systems the coming and going of the seasons might
indeed be a matter of life and death to the
inhabitants of satellite worlds!</p>

<p>Within our solar system the masses of the planets are
practically negligible compared to the mass of the sun,
and it is for this reason that they appear to revolve
about the <em>center</em> of the sun. As a matter of fact, no
body in the universe revolves about the <em>exact geometrical
center</em> of another body, but two mutually attracting
bodies revolve in orbits about their common center of
gravity, which always lies between the two bodies on
the line connecting them and at a distance from each
of them that is in inverse proportion to the mass of
the body. The moon does not revolve about the <i>center
of the earth</i>, but about the <i>center of gravity</i> of the earth
and moon, which lies on the line connecting the two
bodies and at a distance from the earth's center that
is one eighty-first of the distance from the center of the
earth to the center of the moon, since this represents the
ratio of the masses of the two bodies. This center of
gravity of the earth and moon, lies, then, about two
thousand miles from the earth's center, and about this
point both earth and moon trace out orbits of revolution
that are identical in form and differ only in size. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the same way each of the planets of the solar system
revolves about the center of gravity of itself and the
sun, but the mass of the sun is so far in excess of the
combined masses of all the planets that we may consider,
for all practical purposes, that the planets revolve
about the sun's center, the center of gravity of the
system being within the sun, just as the center of
gravity of the earth and moon is within the earth.</p>

<p>Prof. T. J. J. See found from the investigation
of forty binary star orbits that the average eccentricity
of double star orbits is twelve times as great as the
average eccentricity of a planetary orbit, and that the
masses of the component suns never differ very
greatly. The center of gravity of a binary system,
therefore, lies at a great distance from the centers
of the stars, and about this point, as a focus, the stars
move in orbits that are exactly similar in form but
differ in size in inverse proportion to the ratio of
the masses. Since the orbits of binaries are, moreover,
very highly eccentric, the two suns are, as we have
said, anywhere from two to nineteen times nearer to
each other at periastron than they are at "apastron."</p>

<p>We have spoken so far only of systems of two
associated suns, but many systems exist in which three
or more sun-like bodies are in revolution about a
common center of gravity. Frequently two fairly
close suns are in revolution about a common center
of gravity, in a period, say, of fifty or sixty years,
while a third sun revolves at a comparatively great
distance about the center of gravity of itself and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the first pair in a period of several hundred years.
Or possibly the third sun also possesses a close attendant
and the two pairs revolve in a period of great
length about a common center of gravity.</p>

<p>Such, for instance, are the systems of <i>Zeta Cancri</i>
and <i>Epsilon Lyræ</i>. In the former system the closer
components revolve rapidly about their center of gravity
in a period of about sixty years, while the remote
companion shows irregularities in its motion that indicate
that it is revolving about a dark body in a period of
seventeen and a half years, while the two together are
revolving very slowly in a period of six or seven centuries,
about a common center of gravity with the first pair
in a retrograde direction.</p>

<p>The wider pair of <i>Epsilon Lyræ</i> is a naked-eye
double for it can be seen as a double star by a keen
eye, while even a three-inch telescope will separate
each of the components into a double star. So extensive
is this system that the periods of revolution of
the closer components occupy several centuries, one
pair appearing to revolve about twice as rapidly as
the other, while the period of revolution of the two
pairs about a common center is probably a matter of
thousands of years. The gap that separates the two
pairs may be so great that light requires months to
cross it.</p>

<p>These multiple systems are by no means exceptional.
They are to be found in profusion among the brilliant
<i>Orion</i> stars. They have been referred to as "knots" of
stars and it has been suggested that they may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
originated as local condensations in one vast nebulous
tract. A system of only two components appears to be
the exception rather than the rule, groups of several
connected suns being more numerous than single pairs.</p>

<p>In all of these double and multiple systems there
exists the possibility of minute satellites, such as our
own earth, in attendance upon some one component of
the system. Such tiny bodies shining only by reflected
light from a nearby brilliant sun would be hopelessly
invisible in the most powerful telescope.</p>

<p>We can only assume that it is far more reasonable
to believe in than to disprove the existence of such
satellites.</p>

<p>Our own solar system, then, represents neither in its
mechanical nor physical features, the only possibilities
for the maintenance of life; it can neither be considered
a unique form, nor even the most generally
prevalent form in the universe.</p>

ASTRONOMICAL DISTANCES</h2>


<p>The grandeur of the scale upon which the visible
universe is fashioned lies almost beyond human
comprehension. In measuring the vast extent of our
own solar system, which is but a single unit in the
system of the stars, we may have recourse to some
earthly standard of measurement, such as the mile.
But when we desire to express in terms of units that
can be grasped by our imagination, the distances of the
stars that lie far, far beyond, we find that all ordinary
standards of measurement become utterly inadequate
for our purpose. In the measurement of celestial distances
within the solar system the unit employed is
either the familiar mile or kilometer or the "astronomical
unit," which is the mean distance from the
earth to the sun (ninety-two million nine hundred
thousand miles in round numbers).</p>

<p>In the measurement of distances <em>beyond</em> the solar
system the unit employed is either the <i>light-year</i> or
more recently the <i>parsec</i>, which is rapidly replacing the
light-year among astronomers. A "light-year" is the
distance that light, with its finite but almost unimaginable
velocity of one hundred and eighty-six thousand
miles <em>per second, travels in a year</em>. It is equal in round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
numbers to sixty-three thousand times the distance from
the earth to the sun or approximately six thousand
billions of miles. The parsec is equal to three and
twenty-six hundredths (3.26) light-years, and it is
approximately two hundred thousand times the distance
from the earth to the sun. It is "the distance of a star
with the <i>parallax</i> of a second," a fact which its name,
parsec, conveys to us. In other words, at the distance
of one parsec the distance from the earth to the sun,
"the astronomical unit," would subtend an angle equal
to one second of an arc. This angle is spoken of as the
parallax of the star. The larger the parallax, that is,
the larger the angle the astronomical unit or radius
of the earth's orbit subtends, viewed from the star, the
nearer the star is to us. The fact that there is no
known star within one parsec, or three and twenty-six
hundredths light-years, of the sun shows the immensity
of the scale of the universe of stars.</p>

<p>Before considering the distances of the stars and the
extent of the sidereal system of which our sun and his
satellites form a part, let us undertake to express the
distance of the sun, moon and planets from the earth
and the extent of the solar system in terms with which
we are familiar.</p>

<p>The nearest to the earth of all celestial bodies is its
satellite, the moon. So near is the moon that if we
should make on some great plain a model of the solar
system in which the astronomical unit, the distance
from earth to sun, would be four hundred feet, the
distance between the earth and moon would be only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
one foot. On the same scale the most distant planet
Neptune would be two and one-quarter miles away.</p>

<p>Granted that it were possible to escape the earth's
gravitational bonds and to travel by our swiftest means
of conveyance, the airplane, through interplanetary
space, let us consider how long it would take us to
reach the moon, sun and planets if our speed were
maintained at a uniform rate of two hundred miles an
hour. An airplane traveling at this rate would circumnavigate
the earth in a little over five days and would
reach the moon in seven weeks. A trip to the sun,
however, would take fifty-three years.</p>

<p>After traveling for fourteen and a fraction years
we would pass the orbit of Venus and eighteen years
later the orbit of Mercury. If we preferred to travel
outward from the earth in the direction of Mars and
the outer planets instead of toward the sun, more than
twenty-seven years would elapse before we would reach
the orbit of Mars. An airplane journey to Jupiter
would be a matter of more than two hundred years,
to Saturn four hundred and fifty years, to Uranus
nearly one thousand years, and to Neptune, about one
thousand five hundred years. To cross the solar system
on the diameter of Neptune's orbit in an airplane,
traveling day and night without stopping at the rate of
200 miles per hour would take more than three thousand
years. The sun's attraction reaches far beyond
Neptune's orbit, however. There are comets belonging
to the solar system compelled by the sun's attraction to
accompany him on his travels through space that return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
periodically to the immediate vicinity of the sun from
regions far beyond the orbit of Neptune and there is
also the possibility that one or more undiscovered
planets may travel around the sun in orbits far exterior
to Neptune's orbit.</p>

<p>Measured in terms of familiar units, such as are
employed for the measurement of distances on our
own planet, the extent of the solar system is tremendously
great. Viewed from Neptune, the sun is
so far away that it presents no appreciable disk. It
is in this sense star-like to the Neptunians, but at the
distance of Neptune the stars appear no more brilliant
and no nearer than they do to us.</p>

<p>To Neptune the sun, though star-like in form, supplies
a very appreciable quantity of light and heat
(one nine-hundredth of the amount the earth receives)
while the amount of light and heat that Neptune
receives from the nearest stars is entirely inappreciable.
When our airplane reaches Neptune after a journey
of one thousand five hundred years, it is, as it were,
just clearing the ground for its flight to the stars.
To cover the intervening space to the nearest star,
traveled by light in four and a third years, an airplane
would need <em>fourteen and a half million years</em>. In
that time the solar system itself would be in some
far distant part of the universe, since it is speeding
onward through space at the rate of twelve miles a
second or about four astronomical units a year.</p>

<p>Changing now our unit of measurement that we
may express interstellar distances in comprehensible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
numbers, we prepare to travel from the earth to the
stars with the velocity of light.</p>

<p>With this velocity, one hundred and eighty-six
thousand miles per second, we circumnavigate our
globe in one-seventh of a second, reach the moon in
one and a fourth seconds and the sun in eight minutes.
In a little over four hours we pass the orbit of
Neptune and are started on our journey to the stars,
penetrating further and further into interstellar space.
For a year we travel and reach not a single star
though we are speeding ever onward with the velocity
of light. We have now covered the distance of one
light-year, which means that the waves of light from
the sun we have left behind must travel for a year
before they reach us. We continue our journey and
find ourselves next at a distance of one parsec from
the sun. We have traveled a distance of approximately
three and a quarter light-years, and were it
possible to see the earth as well as the sun at this distance,
the two would appear to be but one second of
arc apart, a distance that requires the most careful
adjustment and manipulation of the telescope to measure
accurately. We are still one light-year distant
from Alpha Centauri, the nearest of the bright stars.
A few of the stars will now appear somewhat brighter
than they appeared to us on earth, but the majority
of the stars appear just as we see them here and the
forms of the constellations remain practically unchanged
in appearance, for we are only beginning our
journey through the sidereal universe and our position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
in it has only shifted by a very slight amount.
If we should continue our journey to the immediate
vicinity of Alpha Centauri, we would find that it is
not like our own sun, a single star, but is a binary
star consisting of two suns in revolution around
their common center of gravity. The distance of this
binary system from the solar system has been measured
with considerable accuracy and is known to
be four and a third light-years. Though there may
be a few faint stars or non-luminous stars nearer to
us than Alpha Centauri, this star has long held the
distinction of being the nearest of the stars. As the
sun continues his journey through the universe the
two stars, Alpha Centauri and our sun, will finally
draw away from each other after many ages have
passed and some other sun of space will be our nearest
star. The distances that separate the stars from each
other probably average as great as the distance from
the sun to Alpha Centauri. Within a sphere whose
center is at the earth and whose radius is five parsecs,
or about sixteen light-years, there are only about
twenty known stars. There is, therefore, small chance
of collision among bodies that are so small in proportion
to the tremendous intervals of space that
separate them from each other. There is ample room
for the individual stars to pursue their journey through
space without interfering with each other's motion
so long as they are as widely scattered as they appear
to be in this portion of the universe. The fact that
our own sun has continued its journey through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
universe for some hundreds of millions of years without
any catastrophe such as would result from closely
approaching or colliding with another sun of space
shows how enormous is the scale upon which our
sidereal system is fashioned.</p>

<p>Stars that are ten, fifty or even one hundred light-years
from the earth are our nearest neighbors in
space. They are the stars that show a slight displacement
in the heavens or measurable parallax, viewed
from opposite sides of the earth's orbit. There are
probably a thousand stars among the hundreds of
millions of stars within reach of the greatest telescopes
whose distances have been determined in light-years
by direct measurement of their displacement in the
heavens resulting from the change of position of the
earth in its orbit. The most distant of the stars are
apparently immovable in the heavens showing neither
the effect of the sun's motion or their own motion
through space. Methods for finding the distances of
many far remote stars and star-clusters have been
devised, however, and some comparatively recent
investigations have given results for the distances of
these objects indicating that the diameter of the system
of stars to which our sun belongs is approximately
three hundred thousand light-years. It is difficult
to grasp the full significance of this fact. It means
that hundreds of millions of the suns of space throng
the visible universe at distances from us and from
each other running into hundreds, thousands and even
hundreds of thousands of light-years. The light waves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
from some tiny object that we view today in one
of our great reflectors may have started on their
journey through space over one hundred thousand years
ago when men of the Old Stone Age inhabited our
planet earth!</p>

<p>Astronomers have found as a result of their investigations
that the sidereal system to which our solar
system belongs is in the form of a flattened spheroid
with its longest axis in the plane of the Milky Way.
The extent of this star system composed of hundreds
of millions of individual suns in addition to nebulæ
and clusters is probably something like three hundred
thousand light-years along its longest axis, while globular
star clusters lying above and below its central plane
are estimated to be at distances from it ranging from
ten thousand to two hundred thousand light-years.
This entire organized system is our sidereal universe.
Space beyond is unexplored. The globular star clusters
are among the most distant celestial objects so far
discovered. The spiral nebulæ may be entirely within
the limits of this system or they may be even more
distant than the globular clusters for their distances
are not known as yet.</p>

<p>There is a possibility that our sidereal universe, vast
as it is known to be, may be but a unit in some still
greater unit and that other similar systems lie beyond
the reach of existing telescopes at unimaginable
distances.</p>

<p>The mind of man is overwhelmed by the thought
of sidereal systems as vast as our own lying far beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
his ken. Whether or not such external systems do
exist and are with our own sidereal system units in
some still vaster creation we cannot know.</p>

<p>So vast, indeed, is this one visible universe of ours
that the mind of man, accustomed to earthly standards,
cannot comprehend its magnitude or the infinitesimal
size of our whole solar system compared to it.</p>

SOME ASTRONOMICAL FACTS WORTH
REMEMBERING</h2>


<p>Kepler's Three Laws of Planetary Motion:</p>

<p>I. The planets move in ellipses with the sun at
one focus.</p>

<p>II. The radius vector of a planet (line adjoining sun
and planet) sweeps over equal areas in equal times.</p>

<p>III. The square of the time of revolution (the year)
of each planet is proportional to the cube of its mean
distance from the sun.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sir Isaac Newton discovered that the law of gravitation
extends to the stars. That is, every mass in the
universe attracts every other mass with an attraction
directly proportional to the product of the masses and
inversely proportional to the square of the distances
between them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ocean tides are caused by the difference between the
attraction of the sun and moon for the main body of
the earth and their attraction for different particles of
the earth's surface. The tide-raising force of the
disturbing body is proportional to its mass and inversely
proportional to the cube of its distance. The tides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
produced by the sun are, therefore, only two-fifths as
great as the tides produced by the moon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of infinite
radius, with the earth at its center, upon which the
celestial bodies are considered to be projected for
convenience in determining their positions with respect to
fixed points of reference in the heavens.</p>

<p>The north and south poles of the heavens are the
points on the celestial sphere directly above the north
and south poles of the earth.</p>

<p>The celestial equator is the great circle in which the
plane of the earth's equator intersects the celestial
sphere. It passes through the east and west points of
the horizon and through the zenith&mdash;or point directly
overhead&mdash;at the earth's equator.</p>

<p>The ecliptic is the great circle in which the plane
of the earth's orbit intersects the celestial sphere. The
celestial equator and the ecliptic are inclined to each
other at an angle of 23&frac12;°, which is called the obliquity
of the ecliptic. The two points in which the celestial
equator and the ecliptic intersect are called respectively
the vernal equinox and the autumnal equinox.</p>

<p>The vernal equinox is an important point of reference
on the celestial sphere.</p>

<p>As the position of a point on the earth's surface is
determined by its longitude and latitude so the position
of an object on the celestial sphere&mdash;star, sun,
planet&mdash;is determined by its Right Ascension and
Declination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>The Declination of a celestial object is its distance
north or south of the celestial equator, measured in
degrees, minutes and seconds of arc, on a great circle
of the celestial sphere passing through the object and
north and south poles of the heavens. These great
circles are called hour circles and they correspond to
the meridians or circles of longitude on the earth's
surface. The declination of an object in the heavens
corresponds to the latitude of a point on the earth's
surface. The Right Ascension of a point on the
celestial sphere corresponds to the longitude of a point
on the earth's surface. It is measured&mdash;as longitude is
measured&mdash;in degrees, minutes and seconds of arc or in
hours, minutes and seconds of time&mdash;eastward along
the celestial equator from the hour circle passing
through the vernal equinox to the foot of the hour
circle passing through the object. The hour circle
passing through the vernal equinox is the zero meridian
for the celestial sphere just as the meridian of
Greenwich is the zero meridian on the earth's surface.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The mean distance of the earth from the sun is
92,900,000 miles and is called the astronomical unit.</p>

<p>The sun with its satellites advances through the
universe at the rate of 4 astronomical units in a year
or approximately one million miles a day.</p>

<p>The parallax of a star is the angle at the star subtended
by the radius of the earth's orbit, 92,900,000
miles, or the astronomical unit. It is, in other words,
the angular distance between the earth and sun as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
viewed from the star. The larger the parallax the
nearer the star. The largest known stellar parallax is
that of Alpha Centauri and its value is 0".75.</p>

<p>The light-year is the distance that light travels in one
year. It is equal to about 63,000 astronomical units or
nearly six trillion (6,000,000,000,000) miles. The
velocity of light is 186,000 miles per second.</p>

<p>The parsec is equal to 3.26 light-years. It is the
distance of a star that has a parallax of one second
of arc.</p>

<p>The apparent magnitude of a star is its apparent
brightness estimated on a scale in which a difference
of one magnitude corresponds to a difference in brightness
of 2.51, or the fifth root of one hundred. A
difference of five magnitudes corresponds to a difference
one one hundredfold in brightness, of ten magnitudes
to ten thousandfold in brightness. In exact measurements
on this scale magnitudes are estimated to tenths.</p>

<p>Stars that are one magnitude brighter than stars
of the standard first magnitude are of the zero magnitude
and stars still brighter are of negative magnitudes.</p>

<p>Sirius is a star of the -1.6 magnitude. Jupiter
at opposition is of -2.0 magnitude and Venus at
greatest brilliancy of -4.0 magnitude. The sun on
this scale of comparative brightness is of the -26.7
apparent magnitude. The faintest stars visible in the
most powerful telescope in the world&mdash;the 101-inch
Mt. Wilson Hooker telescope&mdash;are of the twentieth
magnitude.</p>

<p>The <em>absolute</em> magnitude of a star is its apparent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
magnitude at the standard distance of ten parsecs or
32.6 light years. The absolute magnitude of the sun
is five. That is, the sun would be a fifth-magnitude
star at the standard distance of 32.6 light-years. The
absolute magnitudes of stars indicate how bright they
would be relatively if they were all at the same standard
distance. Apparent magnitudes indicate how
bright the stars appear to be at their true distances.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The mean distance of the moon from the earth is
approximately 240,000 miles or sixty times the earth's
radius.</p>

<p>The sun is four hundred times farther away than
the moon and its diameter is about four hundred times
greater than the moon's diameter.</p>

<p>The nearest star is about 275,000 times more distant
than the sun, and the most distant known object, the
globular star cluster, N.G.C. 7106, is about fourteen
billion times more distant than the sun.</p>

<p>The earth is a spheroid flattened at the poles and its
polar diameter is about twenty-seven miles shorter than
its equatorial diameter. An object weighs less at the
poles than at the equator.</p>

<p>The earth's interior is as rigid as steel and probably
consists of a core of magnetic iron surrounded by an
outer stony shell.</p>

<p>Eclipses of the sun occur when the moon passes between
the earth and sun. They can only occur at the
time of new moon. There must be at least two solar
eclipses every year separated by an interval of six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
months and there may be as many as five solar eclipses
in a year. Eclipses of the moon occur when the earth
comes between the sun and moon, and the moon passes
into the earth's shadow. Eclipses of the moon can
only occur at full moon. There may or may not be
eclipses of the moon every year. The greatest number
of eclipses than can occur in any one year, solar and
lunar combined, is seven and the least number is two
and in that case they are both solar eclipses.</p>

<p>The sun is a yellow, dwarf star of a density of one
and one-fourth that of water and with a surface temperature
of about 12,000° F. except in sun-spot regions
where the temperature is about 6,000° F. It is probably
gaseous throughout.</p>

<p>The sun, as well as the planets, rotates on its axis
and different portions of the surface rotate at slightly
different rates. The average period of the rotation of
the sun on its axis is about twenty-six days.</p>

<p>The sun is a variable star with a twofold variation.
One is of long period during the eleven-year sun-spot
cycle with a range of from three to five per cent. The
other is a short irregular variation with a period of a
few days, weeks or months and a range of from three
to ten per cent.</p>

<p>Sun-spots are solar cyclones and appear black only
by contrast with their hotter and brighter surroundings.
They come in eleven-year cycles (approximately) with
periods of maximum and minimum appearance.</p>

<p>The brightness and blue color of the sky is due to
the scattering of sunlight by the molecules of oxygen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
and nitrogen in the earth's upper atmosphere. If
there were no atmosphere the skies would appear black
except in the direction of the heavenly bodies, which
would be visible by day as well as by night.</p>

<p>The solar corona is the rare outer envelope of the sun
and it is visible only during a total eclipse of the sun.
It is partly of an electrical nature and it varies in form
during the sun-spot cycle. It often extends to a distance
of several solar diameters on either side of
the sun.</p>

<p>The warmth and the habitability of the earth's surface
is due to the presence of water-vapor and carbon-dioxide
in the atmosphere. Without these substances
in the atmosphere life on the earth's surface would be
impossible.</p>

<p>Half of the earth's atmosphere and all clouds lie
within seven miles of the earth's surface, and at high
elevations above the earth the temperature is many
degrees below zero.</p>

<p>The temperature of space approaches the absolute
zero of -459° F.</p>

<p>The only planets in the solar system with the exception
of the earth that might possibly support life are
Venus and Mars.</p>

<p>Stars shine by their own light but planets shine only
by reflected light from the sun.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If the earth were represented by a six-inch school
globe the sun would be on the same scale a globe fifty-four
feet in diameter. Mercury would be a small ball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
two and a third inches in diameter. Venus would be
another six-inch globe. Mars would be a ball about
the size of a baseball, three and a fifth inches in diameter.
The moon would be about the size of a golf ball,
one and a half inches in diameter. The largest asteroids
would be the size of marbles. Average-sized asteroids
would be the size of shot and the smallest would be
merely grains of sand.</p>

<p>Jupiter would be a huge globe standing as tall as a
man five feet six inches in height. Saturn would be
a smaller globe four and a half feet in diameter and its
ring system would extend to a distance of five and a
half feet on either side of the globe. Uranus would be
represented by a globe almost exactly two feet in
diameter and Neptune would be a slightly larger globe
with a diameter of two feet two and a half inches.</p>

<p>The satellites of the outer planets would range in
size from tennis and golf balls for the largest, to marbles
for the smaller and grains of sand for the smallest.</p>

<p>On the same scale of measurement the distance of
the six-inch globe of the earth from the fifty-four foot
globe representing the sun would be one and one-tenth
miles. The moon would be placed fifteen feet from the
earth-globe and the diameter of the solar system on the
same scale measured across the orbit of Neptune would
be sixty-six miles. The nearest star on this scale would
be three hundred thousand miles away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If the distance from the earth to the sun is taken
as one inch so that the scale of the universe is reduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
six trillion times, the diameter of the solar system
across Neptune's orbit is five feet and the distance of
one light-year comes out almost exactly equal to one
mile. The nearest star to the five-foot solar system
would be four and a third miles away; the most distant
known object would be two hundred and twenty thousand
miles away, and the extent of the visible universe
would be three hundred thousand miles. On the
same scale the diameter of our sun would be about
one hundredth of an inch and the diameters of the
giant stars Antares and Betelgeuze would be four
inches and two and three-fourth inches respectively.
To see the earth we would need a microscope.</p>

<p>Obvious typographical errors have been repaired.</p>

<p>Mid-paragraph illustrations were moved near to the text describing the illustrated material.</p>

<p>Redundant title&mdash;Astronomy for Young Folks&mdash;on p. 3 was deleted.</p>

<p><a href="#canst">P. 3</a>: Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth&mdash;"Canst" is assumed in blank space.</p>

<p><a href="#star">P. 25</a>: brighter object than the nearby star Aldebaran&mdash;"star" is assumed in blank space.</p>

<p><a href="#note">P. 122</a>: Illustration originally stated "See note page 126". That statement was removed,
and the actual note from page 126 was moved to its place with the illustration.</p>

<p><a href="#dupl">P. 174</a>: [...]&mdash;duplicate of later line "occurred at L'Aigle, France, in 1803. Between two" appeared at this
spot. Possible missing text where the line occurred.</p>

<p>Data in tables retained as in original, but may be incorrect&mdash;for example, the <a href="#mars">escape velocity of Mars</a>, represented
as 1.5 miles per second in Table I, is closer to 3.1.</p>
